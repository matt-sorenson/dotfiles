Usage dot-lint [-h|--help] [--unsupported-success] [-t|--type <type>] <filename> [<display_name>]

Arguments:
  <filename>          The file to lint.
  <display_name>  The filename to display in error messages (default: <filename>).
                      This is useful when the file being linted is staged and
                      the staged file is being linted instead of the file on the filesystem.

Options:
  --unsupported-success    Return success even if the file type is unsupported.
                           This is useful when you want to lint from githooks and
                           don't 'know' the file type.
  -t, --type               Type of file to lint [zsh, sh, bash, ksh, dash, lua] (default: auto detection).
  --verbose                Show verbose output.
  -h, --help               Show this message.
