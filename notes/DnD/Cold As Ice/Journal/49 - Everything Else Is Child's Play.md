# 49 - Everything Else Is Child's Play

## ðŸ“… 12th of Uktar, 21:00; inside Sunblight

I pull the gauntlet off xardaroc & notice that his arm has a bunch of spikes from the gauntlet

I try to fashion some rope around the spikes so it'll pierce that instead of my arm

I put the gauntlet on and it slowly adjusts to my size and then 8 spikes go into my

Arm.

I get a warm sensation, start hearing deep chuckle

Feel a sharp pain mentally and take a bunch of psychic damage

And hear Asmodeus speaking in my head

He asked me what my goals are, I reply getting warm, he says our goals may align.

I ask what his goals are and he says he's shared less with people he's admired more and tells me to enjoy the gauntlet

We discuss, then decide to destroy the forge, in the main room inspecting it we can see the heart of it, I tell everyone to step back and hit it with several eldritch blasts destroying it.

We then head back to the elevators, sending the mind flayer on it's way.

On the upper layer we tell grandma that 'she' was down below so she's not surprised. She gives us a chest of 200g & gives us 4 kegs of mushroom ale.

We then depart the fortress and trek to our carts/animals. We load everything up. We say goodbye to talltree. Ishamael asks talltree if his clan has any dragonbones, he says they do and promises us some if we stop by, marking the location on our map before heading out.

Thodurr ties the carts together and controls them while we rest in the cart and head towards Easthaven.

We run into a lady who asks us if we want to steal from a god. We say we don't have time because of the dragon, she asks if she can help and if she can follow along with us.

Thodurr notices 2 of the kobalds skin seem to be rotting away and has white eyes.

When we reach easthaven we find it half destroyed, we find someone who tells us it started ~6 hours ago. We head off towards Termalaine

We reach Termolain and head to the mayors breakfast place (the blue clam).

Otis realizes Vellynne Harpell is a necromancer. Otis & Ishamael offer to help write a contract for her and her kobalds

We find the speaker at the clam, Ishamael sits down at his table. He thanks us for helping him with his possesion, but we don't have time, we tell him about the dragon

He starts an evacuation to the mines, we discuss keeping the balista on the wagon. I'll be on a sled blasting eldritch blasts,

Sled Driver: Kobald

Gray sees the dragon in the distance to the east and horns are blown to alert the town.

Feel slight sense of un-ease from the gauntlet
