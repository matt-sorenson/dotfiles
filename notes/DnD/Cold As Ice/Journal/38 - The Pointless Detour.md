# 38 - The Pointless Detour

## ðŸ“… 8th of Uktar, 7:54pm; near the Lost Spire of Netheril (Snow Forest map)

The group is beat down (except for me) and decides to sleep in the forest. We set up a fire and arrange ourselves around it.

 Attempt Long Rest...
 
 After 45 minutes, Mr. Kitty suddenly disappears from Otis' warm embrace while he was sleeping, leaving only threads behind. Otis wakes the group to share the bad news. By all accounts, it was alive for less than half a day, leading us to question the machine's reliability. Fzzan could be next if the rules are the same.

Ishamael convinces him to write down his thoughts on parchment in case of memory loss. We go back to resting.

Ishamael attunes to the Shield Guardian Amulet. He becomes aware of a location 57 miles to the southwest that is important to the amulet.

Hirakas reads Ajamar's Guide to the Phantastic. It's a book for younger readers regarding illusion spells. It was a short and easy read, so he also reads The Unfettered Mind. It talks about how to become a disembodied mind.

12:05am ...

ThodÃ¼rr feels a weight shift in the wagon and wakes up. He notices a pile of snow and ash, and wakes up Ishamael to investigate. They find the quill and paper Fzzan was using, sitting on top of the pile.

ðŸ’¤ Completed Long Rest

## ðŸ“… 9th of Uktar, 4:05am; near the Lost Spire of Netheril (Snow Forest map)

We inform Krintaas about what happened. He is quite emotionless and seems to lack direction, but we offer him a place to stay at The Talking Moose.

We travel to our Outpost on Kelvin's Cairn to offload the chardalin we've been hauling around this whole time. The bodies we left outside appear to have been altered since we were here last.

I notice some movement in the northern tower, and alert the group that somebody is in our home. We approach the front gate and see that the drawbridge is down. As we start walking across...

âš” 8:43am - Encounter Begins

Invisible creatures ambush us, causing some light damage. All of us are surprised except for Hirakas.

It turns out to be the grow-dwarves. True to their name, one becomes enlarged next to ThodÃ¼rr and Ishamael.

Hirakas lands a hex and an Eldritch Blast on one of them.

A Duergar Mind Master flanks me to the south and lands a dagger hit on me, but I don't feel it much.

ThodÃ¼rr takes a crit hit to the groin as they continue to try and surround us. Otis casts a radiant spell around him.

Ishamael casts an area spell on the two southern-most duergar and attempts to charm them, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on them. He tries an old man shove instead, but it fails.

Hirakas summons the tentacle to assist as well as two Eldritch Blasts, but all of the attacks miss.

ThodÃ¼rr rages and hits back at the duergar that attacked him, right in the balls. It's super dead and falls backward into the pit below. He turns around, and just before attacking again, Otis comes with the assist and casts Divinity on ThodÃ¼rr to help him land the second attack.

The second grow-dwarf next to me gets buffeted by Otis' radiant spell and tries to step away, but not before Hirakas lands a reaction attack against it.

I take the opportunity to finish it off, then turn around to take a shot at the Mind Master behind me. It tries to respond by attacking me with his dagger again, but fails to hit me the first time. It flails around and swings again, this time connecting for a little bit of damage.

A Hammerer appears in the doorway. First I shoot the badly injured duergar in the ear, killing it. Then I shoot at the Hammerer's leg, knocking it prone. Another one appears from the doorway next to it soon after.

As more attacks hit the Hammerers, 2 more duergar appear from invisibility, but miss their initial attacks.

We clean up the rest of the attackers.
