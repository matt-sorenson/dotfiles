# 29 - A two faced warden

## ðŸ“… 5th of Uktar, 11:18; North of Lonelywood

We spend some time discussing Valhalla Sandwiches, they are delicious

I inspect the Duergar Hammerer, it has has some sort of spike holding the head stiff, but have a hard time finding anything other than it being an interesting suit, we debate taking it with us to see if we can find someone to give us more info on it before deciding to do so.

We Search the other Duergar we only find their armor and weapons

We find some Chardalyn Javelins & Flails on the berserkers

I kneel down and start the ritual to detect magic in the area as the other's continue to investigate the area. The Chardalyn seems to be magic, but I can't tell what type of magic. Touching the crystals feels cold, and it vibrations almost feel like a shiver, I don't like them.

While I was doing the ritual Thodurr started building a fire and the living duergar was shackled with manacles.

Otis pulls out the stew pot and I fill it with the decanter of endless water. I like it!

We start the enhanced interrogation of the surviving duergar about the chardalyn, they're building WMDs to destroy the ten towns and for some sort of armor he calls the conduit.

We also learned the sunblight is a building (also made of chardaly), where they're building the weapon.

The construct may be a dragon!

The Duergar are not aligned with the berserkers, as far as he knows they're nomads, not really organized

We debate what to do with the surviving duergar, finally deciding to take Ice Hitler to Revel's End.

After an hour or so the duergar awakens

We arrive at Revel's End and discuss our asks with the guard. Ishameal also brings up our prisoner and they seem convinced by our story, lets hope the speaker is never called upon about Ice Hitler.

We get our animals into the stables while we wait for the guard to speak with the warden about speaking with the prisoner we seek.

Thodurr has Ishamael attempt to hide a dagger in his hair so he has a weapon if shit goes down.

The guards take the rest of our weapons and guide us into the prison proper, we meet with the warden (Marta Marthanis). They take custody of Ice Hitler & Marta takes us to a side room to discuss Prisoner 237 before we meet him. Thodurr offers her a mug of mead, and a dwarven voice takes possession of Marta and drinks a bunch of mead. To get Marta back we bore the dwarven voice. She has Vaelish brought to the room, he looks to be covered in piss & shit so I cast prestigitation to clean him cause I don't want to smell that.

He's in prison for racketeering while trying to take the speakership of brin shander, he has some connection to Dzzan and Ishameal & 237 debate who will give info first.

- Starts giving info on arcane brotherhood
  - Started ~4000 years ago with a tree in lushkin, The Host Tower of the Arcane
  - Dzzan is a red wizard of thay
  - Heard search for netherese city, they assumed it was in the Reghed Glacier (out east)
    - Netherese cities are ancient, big floating cities
    - Said to be able to control the weave better than the gods
    - Carsis tapped into the weave but screwed up so badly that all magic
      disappeard for an hour and all the cities crashed.
      - Trying to stop desert black thing the Phaerimm
    - City would be filled with advanced ancient technology

Chardalyn left by Crenshinibon

We suddenly hear commotion outside and the torches went out.
