# 33 - The Great Dragon Heist

## ðŸ“… 6th of Uktar, 4:40pm; Dark Duchess

We jump down into the ship's hold and start investigating the frozen treasure as well as nearby cabins. Hirakas finds a crate that was split apart on the floor, but piecing it back together reveals some Elvish script. Ishamael checks over the dead creature and then we try opening the door to the south.

The door is stuck, but after hitting it twice, it gives up and the remaining supports go away. I am great at this.

Behind the door, we find several kobolds. Ishamael casts some kind of spell to stun half the creatures, then Otis runs in and tries to knock them over the head with his hammer. Hirakas sends in Eldritch Blast through the doorway and kills one of them. ThodÃ¼rr walks up to Ishamael and starts giving him a shoulder rub for some reason. I run in after and stab one of them, then knock it out with the hilt of my sword. They give up soon after.

The kobolds start talking about a white dragon's treasure, which sounds like it might be the treasure just in the other cabin. Apparently the dragon can breathe ice and has frozen the treasure in multiple layers.

ThodÃ¼rr uses his strange abilities to start talking to the goat.

1 bah

Yes

2 bah

No

We're taking the goats. Otis reaches the conclusion that the kobolds are racist and threatens to kill them if they leave. We turn toward the frozen treasure and start trying to work our way through it. The ice is very cold and resists warming spells, but the sheer amount of it should make any efforts worth it.

In the meantime, Hirakas explores the remaining cabins on the ship, looking for anything useful.

Amazingly, he comes across the following:

- 150 gp
- 520 sp
- small gold bracelet (25gp)
- large gold bracelet (250 gp)

In other rooms, they find [9:09] and a map.

Later, he finds:

- Hooded lantern
- 3 flasks of oil
- 5 bars of lime soap
- 3 manacles
- 10 torches

Hirakas takes most of it except for the torches and also leaves 4 of the soap bars behind.

### My group breaks through the first layer of ice and discover the following

- 72 gp
- 181 sp
- 325 cp
- 2 pearls (100gp each)

The kobolds try escaping quietly up the broken stairway, but is noticed by Ishamael who was on the upper deck. It sounds like they got away.

### Breaking through the next layer of ice, we retrieve

- 9 tattered of pieces of indigo fabric lined with gold thread (25gp each)
- 3 pieces of quartz (50gp each)
- 1 aquamarine, cracked down the center (250gp)
- 1 scrimshaw figurine etched with magic script

### And the next layer

- 221 gp
- 1ft tall griffen statue gold inlay (250gp)
- black pearl (500gp)
- perdot shaped as leaf (300gp)
- Drift Globe (https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/driftglobe)
- Quiver of Ehlonna (https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/quiver-of-ehlonna)

### Fourth layer of ice

3ft diameter ceramonial bronze bowl inlaid with gems (1000gp)
7 garnets (100gp each)
suit of mithril armor chainmail
near perfect replica of wand of orcus (emits green light from tip)

We pack everything up and get the hell out of there.

## ðŸ“… 6th of Uktar, 7:30pm

We travel back south to put as much distance between us and that dragon as possible.

## ðŸ“… 6th of Uktar, 9:30pm

From behind, we hear a terrible roar. Despite the distance, I know what that is.

## ðŸ“… 7th of Uktar, 3:30am; The Talking Moose

Hirakas splits up the coins and passes out 103gp 2sp 7cp to each person. Then we go through the equipment to divvy it up.

4:50am

Hirakas learns the wand is a very convincing fake, but a fake nonetheless. The perpectual flame on the front emitting the green light is real however.

ðŸ’¤ Long Rest

## ðŸ“… 7th of Uktar, 11:50am

Group wakes up.

Plan: Termalaine (sell stuff), Bryn Shander (sell stuff, yeti)
