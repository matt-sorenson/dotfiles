# 36 - Spire Menagerie

…as we continued down the next floor of this upside down tower Otis checks for pockets of a humanoid insect like creature that Thodurr names as Thri-kreen. We find a couple of books, a skeleton missing a finger, more collapsed stair cases, and a room that is muted from all kinds of sound.

We head further “up” the tower to the floor that holds the wizard from the mirror, the wizard I talked with that burned at the stake, Dazan. Or rather, a simulacrum of Dazan. It seems the simulacrum doesn’t relate to Dazan and wishes to be called Fazan. It seems he’s unable to recharge his magic because he’s just a copy. An illusion so to speak.

We chat with Fazan for a bit and explain of Dazan’s fiery end. Fazan needs help getting out of this spire of Yitherine. A part of the Netheress, a floating city that crashed into the glaciers up here near Ten Towns eons ago. His only ask is to help him use a device here in this spire to make him real again. A device that turns illusions into reality.

Otis and I try to figure out Fazan’s intent. Even a linen dire wolf from Otis crushing the table didn’t seem to provoke him or his zombie looking guard in any way. He’s a part of the Arcane Brotherhood and mentions that others from the Brotherhood are looking for Yitherine like he is. Three women. We agree to help him if he’s able to chat with the speaker of Bryn Shander regarding the Brotherhood activity in the area. He agrees.

During this time Thodurr and Graymond jump across to another area on this tower’s floor and finds what looks like a prayer room to an unknown deity. We sketch up the symbol to see if we’re able to identify it later. Graymond also finds a small brass key and a sealed scroll tube made of shardaline with a scroll of invisibility inside.

We continue “up” the tower again. This time in search of this machine Fazan was talking about. Graymond and Otis head down first and stumble onto some strange creature that attacks them as they get down. Hirakas heads down followed by a hasted Thodurr who quickly beheads the creature. Sadly, us folks above didn’t hear of Otis’s plan to capture the creature to use on the machine. Hopefully we’ll find another.

We continue to check the rooms on this next floor and find a room with a skeleton body inside. I search for a missing finger like the last, but all intact. Instead a wisp leaves the corpse and we make quick work of that too. In this room Otis seems to trip over a grow dwarf and then tackles it, but instead he feels out that it’s just a chest that’s locked. Graymond hands him the bronze key and it opens. Inside there’s a book with three symbols on the cover which instantly disintegrates in Otis’s hands. I have him quickly sketch the symbols on some paper before he forgets. We take the invisible chest which is awkwardly room temperature on the inside.

The last room in this spire is the room we were looking for. Inside is a magical recording of the wizard who made the device. It almost seems like this device was supposed to be on display for others to view and or use. Otis summons another linen creature and out forms a panther. Otis commands it to go stand under the light where the recording gestures to, but nothing happens. Thodurr approaches and holds the Panther up and his life spark ignites the transformation unraveling linen and flesh taking its place.

Thodurr spends some time to converse with the creature and it seems he’s okay with joining up with us and still seems friendly to Otis and the party. Excited with the success of the machine we try again with the dire wolf. The process happens like before, but then the transformation starts to warp into a pile of black ooze that attacks the party. Graymond bravely through himself in front of a brutal attack which is the most notable portion of the encounter. It did seem like it did some damage to some weapons that should be noted in the future as well.

We ponder our decision to help Fazan after seeing this outcome.
