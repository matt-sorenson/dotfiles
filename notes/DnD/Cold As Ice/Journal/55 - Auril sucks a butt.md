# 55 - Auril sucks a butt

Giant axe we found shrinky dinks after Ishamel has studied it for a while.  His guardian holds onto it tightly, very sexy.

We discuss the best way to get into that Auril door – we're hesitant to do the tests since it makes you glow or some shit.  The seal says that it gives you a snowflake halo of some kind, sounds dumb.

Ishmael grabs a fish and slides it around on the ice so the dumb seal looks like a dork.  We pick a door to explore and head in, seeing a big snowflake thing on a door on the back wall with a partially-scratched word above it – we can only make out 'ervation'.  We open the door and find ourselves transported into a weird cave with a blizzard roiling outside.

We find a small boy sitting around a fire.  He's totally not a real person and talks about how much he likes being warm by the fire – his whole existence seems to be predicated about being comfy by the fire.  We converse with him – nothing useful comes out of his mouth, but we can literally see him aging before our eyes.  He's got some kind of pocket watch that is probably a dumb metaphor for something Auril related, but we are too dense to make much sense of it.

We discuss potential options but nothing seems clear – I fully expect he'll simply turn into a  monster if we wait long enough, but that at least that would give us a clear goal.

We end up talking him into going outside – once they're out of shot I put the fire out, thinking that such a dick move would be in line with Auril's thinking but it accomplishes nothing.  Once he comes back inside Ishamel plays with his pocket watch some more -  he pulls out the watch adjustment knob and a snowy halo appears above his head.  He decides he doesn't like that and put the knob back in, causing the halo to disappear.

I decide to perform the ultimate watch stoppage and smash the thing to bits, which doesn't seem to count towards whatever idiotic task it is we are supposed to be performing.  Ishamel, always the bleeding heart, lights the fake person a new fire and takes some weird stale  time bread in return.  Ishamael offers fake timothy some of his rations as well.  This seems weird and pointless as timothy didn't exist 15 minutes ago, but being fake nice to fake people sems to help Ishamael feel good about himself so I keep quiet.

Ishamael has an idea – I take his hourglass and turn it on its side, freezing the sand flow – this causes the snowflake halo to appear above my head.  I then try doing the same thing with Greymond, but with us both touching the hourglass at the same time – we each get the halo.  We do it one final time, but with everyone but Ishamael touching it – snow halos for everyone.

Timothy eventually gets old and finally starts to die, which we reckon will let us leave this moronic challenge cave.  He finally kicks the can so and we get teleported back with our stupid ice halos.

We go to the door and remember that it's a magic talking door that says 'This way shut to all but those who pass the tests of cruelty, endurance, isolation, and preservation' which is some context that would've been useful a while ago.

We go to the next door, which reads 'isolation'.  We find ourselves in a cave with a fire again, but it's pure dark outside.  Figuring this means we need to be alone and sad I wander off into the dark on my own and sit on the floor by myself.

It's dark, cold and scary but I'm irritated enough at this whole thing that I'm able to easily focus on that irritation and before I know it we're teleported back.

I find myself with a whole NEW ice halo(making two), but quickly realize that Thodurr is freaking out and cannot remember who he is.  We leave him with

Endurance: We find ourselves outside on a frozen lake, and can see a sigil up high on top of a mountain and one deep below in the icy water.  We make a plan to have Hirakas castt fly on me and greymond, and we carry him to the sigil up above.  We all touch it and are teleporated out without event.

Thodurr is still addled on our return – I attempt to talk to him but he's a turd without his memories so I leave him to his confusion.

We go into the cruelty door next –I was born for this.  We awaken in a room with a door missing pieces of it.  The outside of the cruelty door has an owl lady who is missing an eye, half her beak, half her ear plumage, one wing is fucked up and one foot is missing.  There is an older man sitting there, chained to the ground, missing an eye.

This one's as trite and obvious as the rest – I gag the man so we don't have to hear his bullshit, and pull his eye out.  Sticking it in the door gives me the last sigil and teleports me out of here.  Hirakas returns quickly with a new sigil, followed shortly by Greymond.

We enter the main chamber, and the locked door to the south swings open.  We see a chamber with ice lady sculptures in it, covered in text.  We open another door, and see the magic book we been looking for resting on a pedastal.  Ghost girl gets excited,runs up to it, touches it and then instantly dies – guess she sorted out her unfinished business.  I take the book and hand it over to Ishamael – we can figure out what to do with it once we've exited.  There is one last room to explore – we open the door and see three lifelike ice sculptures sitting mist.

I'm naturally cautious about this, so I chuck Nass' corpse into the room to see if it triggers anything.  Nothing happens, so I step in befeore hearing a voice in my head asking if I want to 'risk my life for my blessing'.  I recognize the voice as Auril and tell her she's just the stone-cold shits and that I don't want anything from her except the pleasure of watching her stupid beaked face get smashed in by the thundering might of Tempus – she doesn't seem to appreciate that as she appears direclty in front of me, seemingly ready to duke it out.
