# 23 - Mummy Dearest

## ðŸ“… 1st of Uktar, 10:56pm

After 18 seconds of heroic heroism, we defeated the druid hiding in one of the moon rooms, along with the plants she had summoned to attack us.

We found a few items among the dead including an ice sickle and an herbalism kit, neither of which interested me.

Hirakas and Otis opened the sarcophagus in the moon room. Within was a rotting corpse; a fairly recent one by our judgement. It bore some resemblance to the one we just killed [Ravisin].

We decided the best course of action was to set everything on fire in the middle of the moondial, including the body and the aggressive foliage.

Afterward, ThodÃ¼rr and I turn our attention back to the mirror, and begin forming a plan how to get it off the wall. Such a useful item should be with us instead of just sitting here doing nothing. First we tried pulling it off the wall, but it was set in place too securely. Next we pull out our pickaxes and begin carving our way around the mirror. This takes a while [2 hours], but we don't want to break it.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party investigated what appears to be a code or puzzle involving various shapes. I'm sure I could have solved it instantly if I weren't busy with more important matters. During this time they also find 2 glass vials, which appear to be a potion of resistance (radiant) and a potion of vitality.

The group placed the corresponding items into a brazier that looked important, and it suddenly ignites with a silvery flame.

Otis and Ishmael slide open another sarcophagus, and an elven mummy suddenly wakes up and sits upright. We begin talking with him, and he seems friendly, if a bit talkative. His name is Shanar. He seems to think Hirakas is hard of hearing or something. He was also very interested in having food. He tried some of our stew but didn't like it. Otis the Steward is offended.

We learned a few other things â€“ he spent his last few years alive in Icewind Dale and was put to rest here hundreds of years ago. Apparently it's a good area for moonlight, so it's special to him.

He keeps talking (probably starved for attention instead of food), and I start to get annoyed, but keep quiet. He also wants to see the town, but I don't think that's a good idea.

After a few hours, we finally free the mirror from its stone prison and bring it to the cart. It's not theft if it was abandoned. The mummy tries to get on a moose, but it really does not seem to like him and attacks for a bit of damage. We decide to sleep.

ThodÃ¼rr is aggressively licked. We travel back to Lonelywood.
