# 66 - Grow Elfs and Giant Crustaceans

Graymond and Thodurr get into a tussle with some grow elfs that cast illumination magic. Otis summons a large, flying, celestial being. The grow elfs hit hard, but we rebuttal their ambush with some balls getting ripped off by Otis's hands. Another's blasted by Hirakas.

These grow elfs seem to be aligned with demons and possibly fighting against the grow dwarfs. I use my new staff to hopefully understand the words they're speaking.

Otis and his celestial start attacking the demon and the other grow elf that started this ambush. Thodurr, with his bloodthirsty rage, slaughters what was left of them.

They had some poison vials in their pockets. Must be what they used to coat their weapons. Thankfully our dwarfs tanked the poisoned aspect with their natural, booze altered, resistance.

In the room we find a three inch cube that emanates dry heat around itself. Second stew pot? Plus some other uninteresting things like a spell book that Hirakas was drooling to look over and some items worth some gold.

Chatted with Otis's celestial for a bit. Sathia, aka Lord Crotchstomp. Apparently fighting demons since the beginning of time. Seems like a chill dude.

Graymond seems to be under some kind of spell that turns him into a growing dwarf, but not exactly a grow dwarf. He's now taller than me by an inch. Lynn doesn't know what's causing it, but it seems magical.

We slap on our crampons and climb a natural, slippery, slope up to an ice spa filled with giant crustaceans like creatures.

We observe them for a bit. Throw some bag of trick animals. Graymond states that most likely their strengths are equal and their armor less than his.

We all eat some pears to gain some extra buffs before going in. We debate and plan our engagement. We decide on double monkey and one buffed with haste. I'll lure with the charm.
