# 19 - The Story of the Man-Eating Moose

## ðŸ“… 29th of Marpenoth, 11:30

We escort Trex and his remaining compatriots to the town speaker and convince him to give them a chance working in the town and living there, he paid us the 100gp for clearing the mines which we split amongst us.

We got our dogs from the inn and left for Lonelywood, arriving a couple hours later. We're pointed to the speakers house Nimzie who invites us in to speak by someone in town. She offers us some cookies. We discuss the moose, it has been attacking loggers and is albino. After much negotiations we negotiate 35gp, cookies & the deed to a local tavern/inn. We follow here back to her house to meet a recent survivor who's quite bandaged up. He was chopping down a tree when he was attacked. Looked around couldn't see anything, started chopping again and was bitten, knocked down and trampled. Seemed to be about normal size for a moose. Most have had both arms bitten.

We venture into the woods following the lumberjacks tracks. We eventually find some tracks that lead us to a regular moose, after Thodurr does his thing he talks to the moose and it tells us that it has seen the albino moose in the last couple days. Venturing on again we find another regular moose that has recently seen the moose and points us in a direction and leads us towards the albino moose. After a while we run into a brown bear which we swiftly defeat, I take some meat and we carry on finding yet another moose, thodurr spent a while touching himself, I'm not sure if that's actually part of the ritual but he spoke to the meese and both of them continued to lead us on towards the albino moose. Eventually we find 2 more brown meese and thodurr does his thing again. We continue following meese and eventually approach some sort of temple.

There's a gazebo with a brazier, and a berm with a casket surrounded by pillars with Twig, pinecone, flame, feather, humanoid hand on the top. 6 statues robed pointed northward, facial features worn away but have elven ears. One on the north is facing south. In a circular depression there is giant sun dial, snow around it is melted away, not a sun dial but a moon dial. Hole in the north west wall and as I approach I see the albino moose. Red and I try to talk to it but it charges red so we defend ourselves. After we take it down I cast spare the dying and we secure it to prevent it from attacking while we decide what to do.
