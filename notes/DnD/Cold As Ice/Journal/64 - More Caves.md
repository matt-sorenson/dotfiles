# 64 - More Caves

## ðŸ“… 25th of Uktar, 4:37am; inside Caves of Hunger

We check the passages around our, not finding anything to the north or east, but as Otis wanders south he is attacked by 3 snow men. The fight is on.

I run in and get a good fire breath attack off on 2 of the snowmen before using misty step to pop back to safety to think of a next move

Rushing back in there's one remaining and I throw 2 eldritch blasts at its crotch completely wiping it out.

Having cleared the area I suggest resting here, which we do. Not needing actual sleep I volunteer for watch. About an hour into the watch I the shadows behind the shield guardian and it seems strange, but when I go to look closer I don't notice anything. I leave my lantern on the ground next to the shield guardian and go back to my seat. I don't notice anything else for the duration of resting. Everyone else wakens a little before 13:00.

Thodurr seems to be back to his more buff state.

We eat some stew before heading out.

We backtrack a little to make sure we've seen everything in the areas we've been. Otis stops and thinks there's grow dwarfs about. We stop to see if we can find them. Maybe they're levitating.

As we venture a bit deeper we hear mumbling and Otis is attacked by some sort of levitating elf with a crown. We will kill him again! After taking some damage it runs away like a coward through some walls of ice. I bust my way through 2 of the walls and someone else takes out another. Thodurr uses the opportunity I provide to deliver the killing blow and it poofs away.

Looking at the ground below where we killed it there is a skeleton with a well preserved cape & staff. I take the cape and determine it to be a mantle of spell resistance, this will be useful to keep. Otis looks over the staff and determines it's a staff of charming and hands it off to ishamael.

We explore a bit more and find another hole. We decide to go back to the smelly tunnel as we think it might be a dead end and want to clear it out. We enter a tall room with a slick floor and lots of bones. It smells of death. We are attacked by a bloody hyena that appears out of the shadows and a few of the red eyed Kobalds. After a creepy laugh from the hyena my party mates seem off, but we still kill it and the Kobalds. After it dies it shrinks down to a normal size hyena.
