# 12 - The Wild Ferry Ride

After returning from the city town center to pick up our compadre Hirakus, which apparently needed a 1 hour "alone" time in the inn room. *Wink* *Wink* Hey, I ain't gonna judge, people need to have a release on occasion after long cold journeys. Considering the frozen nature of this land, its hard to get it up sometimes, makes sense to make the best use of the warm inn room. Maybe tonight when everyone is sleeping, I can take a whack.

Anyways...

We began our day making our way out to the frozen East Haven ferry to investigate the information we discovered in the note we found in the Kelvins Cairn Dark Dwarf Fortress.

We approached cautiously, I held the bridge to the ferry while Otis, Hirakus, Greymond entered the cabin of the Ferry. They discovered 4 sleeping bags and a map on a desk that detailed a new dark dwarf location to the south called Sunblight.

While Otis was searching for loot in the sleeping bags, he again felt the familiar feeling of an invisible squishy Dark Dwarf butt against his hands, the dark dwarf woke up and combat ensued.

Other then Ishemeal, who stayed on the dock, we all moved in on the one dwarf in the cabin. The dwarf snatched the map that was sitting on the table and while we all failed to command or grapple him, he lands a larges dagger slash against Greymond and runs to the corner.

While this is going on, I am standing in the doorway of the Ferry cabin, I hear a commotion behind me as Ishemeal cast a line of what looked like poison on the dock but no enemy is in sight. Ishmeal calls out that danger is approaching from the docks and considering the invisible nature of our foes, I figured it would be best to listen to him. Plus Otis pointed out that there are 4 sleeping bags, we should expect 3 more bogies. So I left the battle that ensued in the cabin to jump from the boat to the dock to support Ishemeal. Ishemeal also prepares for the invisible enemy by throwing down his strange bag that summons a boar. I really should try talking to some of the beast summoned by that bag.

During the time that Ishemeal and I were preparing for the new dangers that were about to approach us on the docks, the cabin battle ensued. I didn't witness these events but Otis "claimed" that this is what happened. Apparently after the dark dwarf ran into the corner, he shrank down to the size of a cup and tried to escape through a hole in the wall, but Otis commanded it to grovel, halting it to stop in place. Then Otis and Greymond attempted and eventually succeeded to get the Dwarf locked in their mess kit. With the first dwarf locked up, they proceed to join the defense against the new dangers approaching from the Docks.

Back to the adventures on the Dock, a new dark dwarf appears right next to me and tries to shove me off the dock and obviously fails to move my mountainous beautiful pecks. Only Greymond might have the strength to move me.

Immediately after the failed shove attempt, the boar and I react and attack the new Dark dwarf. Further down the dock, a third dark dwarf appears and enlarges themself and begins moving towards Ishemeal and me. Hirakus launches a thunderous magic blast against the dark dwarf that tried to shove me. I followed that energy up by throwing down my shield and pickaxe, bringing out my battle axe, enraging, and landed a mighty killing slash from the head to groin right between its breast.

With one dwarf captured and another dead, our whole party began moving towards the one remaining visible enlarged dark dwarf. Ishmeal orders his Boar to attack the enlarged dwarf. Hirakas commands his tentacle thing to also engage the enlarged dark dwarf and additionally lands a mighty killing magical blast right in the beard of the enlarge dark dwarf. He burned that beard completely off, cleanest shave job I have ever seen. The body of the enlarge dark dwarf, shrinks back to normal and falls onto the icy water below.

Knowing that there was still one dark dwarf that had not appeared, I moved to the other side of the Dock, hoping to run into something. While moving I heard something nearby and blindly sung my weapon, but sadly I made no contact. But I swear something was there. And sure enough I was correct.

The last dark dwarf finally became visible between Otis and me and immediately enlarged. The whole party began launching attacks against the remaining dwarf. During the commotion, the dark dwarf captured in the mess kit, returned to normal size and broke out of the mess kit. He jumped off the dock onto the ice below, hoping to make an escape while we delt with his last compatriot. But me and my axe took one massive swing at the last enlarged dark dwarf, killing it with a slash across its breast in a horizontal manner.

With all the other dark dwarves taken care of, the entire crew collapsed on the last remaining escaping dark dwarf. He didn't make it far, Otis and Greymond knocked him out very quickly.

We had a major opportunity to get some really useful information from this dark dwarf. Most of us other then Ishemeal, who didn't seem too fond of our next tactics, brought the massive cauldron into the Ferry cabin, filled it to half way point with water, which turned to stew. We then stripped and manacled the captured dark dwarf and dumped him into the cauldron and stew.

Otis does his weakest heal to try and bring the prisoner back to life and the dark dwarf wakes up and gets scared sloshing in the cauldron stew and then turns invisible and tries to hide in a corner.

Otis demanded that the dwarf show himself, but is silently ignored. Otis tries to intimidate the prisoner by using his fist, but it has no effect. Instead we told the dark dwarf about that time we killed his brother at the dark dwarf fortress, this seemed to anger the dwarf and spew out some useful information in his anger.

He told us that his father is some all powerful guy who plans to burn everyone and everything in 10 towns. Otis taunts the dark dwarf with the power of his mighty god with a booming voice. The dark dwarf continues to mention some mechanical marvel. And that the dark metal stuff we have found falls from the sky and they have the means to form them into weapons.

I demand who is his father, he answers Xardorok. We ask about sunblight and the meaning of it on the map we found, and we get told that it is their stronghold fortress and where his father lives.

Greymond ask what the dark dwarves have against 10 towns, he responds that we have infested the surface land and they want to take over own it all. They will take what they earned and what is theirs.

The dark dwarf becomes unresponsive and upset at us for killing his brother, so Otis smacks the dwarf on the head with his mace, almost killing it. I then began questioning and threatening to kill him if he doesn't answer, of course he would have to die anyways, but he doesn't need to know that. He tells us that they have the fire, the heart of a dragon, which when contained, it will explode across ten towns. The black ice formed by the Crenshinibon is the only thing that can contain the dragon heart.

The dark dwarf soon realized that we had no plans to let him live, so his last words were, "May father forgive me and damn this land" as Otis puts the dark dwarf out of its misery.

I then left the cabin to fill Ishemeal into the situation, he was fairly confused why the dark dwarf gave away so much information so willingly, but it works out for us. We dump the bodies down a hole made in the ice and leave the dock with the ferry, as if we were never there.

Ishemal then goes to Digglers dingle doots and buys a tiny tea set for his "Daughter", which I think is code word for his new Chiwinga friend.

We also needed to get new mess kits from Rurdens armory for Otis and Greymond after they failed capturing the tiny dark dwarf inside.

We then went to Renaldos s√©ance, reference the notes to the right since I ran out of time writing this up.
