# 76 - The Final Towers of Magic

These ancient wizard towers are odd. I'm not following the intent in the research these wizards were doing. Their magical do-dads seem like a lot of effort in making magic happen. Most of the time they seem to backfire and trap them, or us, mainly Gray, in crystals. But, I digress.

Graymond investigates this large stone slab on the ground in this tower of "transmutation". With his dwarven knowledge, he let's us know that the slab is heavier than expected. We try to lift it a little bit, but without a good grip we're not going to get further.

Otis says, "tangerine", and summons an giant owl into being. He uses the owl to traverse the rest of the tower. Which, by the way, is just flat floors with a large empty slab shaped hole in the middle of each. Standing in the center of the slab you're able to see the top of the tower.

Third floor and up is damaged, from Otis's quick report. Otis, Hirakas, Graymond, and Thodurr head up to the third floor to start investigating through the rubble. Thodurr and Graymond finds some book facts about "magen". Them guards we've seen in previous towers. Hirakas and Otis find some spell scrolls and a wand.

The giant owl ferries them up to the fourth floor. Hirakas finds another spell scroll and Otis a wand. Graymond and Thodurr find nothing of note.

Once again, final floor, Graymond notices a toppled adamantine statue of a netheress woman. The carver was legendary or magically assisted to carve the details in the hair. Sounds like a good addition to the arena.

Hirakas hears a faint little voice in a rubble on the fifth floor. Otis thinks there's another Professor Mustache orb under the rubble, but instead a talking candelabra. Apparently got transformed by the high transmuter wizard. The candelabra mentions of a clock friend in "the vault" below.

Hirakas suggests we get to the vault using some stone shaping, but I guess they just need to find some function of the tower to get in. The candelabra friend notes that the adamantine statue is the high transmuter.

Otis flies up with the giant owl and presses a button found on the ceiling that makes the large stone slab on the first floor "fall" to the ceiling. While this almost squashes Otis, he does reveal the entrance to the vault below.

Otis commands his owl to fly him and the clock friend who flew out of the vault with the stone slab removal. I wave as Otis passes, and Otis integrates the clock person what he knows. The vault contains a lot of gold coins, gems, and various other things of value. He commands the owl to bring down Graymond to figure out how to wedge the vault open.

Otis launches the clock person up and out of the vault, which flies up to the ceiling and destroys the clock person.

The slab falls and traps Otis inside the vault. His owl goes and presses the button again, reversing gravity. This time his owl isn't as lucky and gets squished turning Tangerine back into a figuring of itself.

Otis exits out before the slab falls down for another time. The tablet gets translated by Professor Mustache.

"Eight, stand in thy circle of death and consume poison."

The rest are various gems and some potions Lynn identifies.

Hirakas makes his way down and Otis requests for him to use his Eldritch blast to try opening the slab. That doesn't seem to work, so I climb up and use my mage hand to push the button open instead. Lummie, the friendly candle person warmly greets me. I feel a bit bad that his clock friend seems to be destroyed beyond my capabilities to magically mend.

I keep the vault open as Otis spends some time collecting the rest of the treasure.

I chat with Lummie to see if he knows how to undo his master, but only she would be able to and she's an adamantine statue and cannot do that.

We head to the next tower and plan to bunker down there for a rest.

The Tower of Illusion is surrounded by mist and some kind of eye that follows us. We find some rubble outside the tower that the boys start clearing an entrance into the tower.

We all enter the misty tower and a blast of psychic illusions spike into our minds before fading away.

Otis starts shaping the rubble of the tower into a reformed stone wall, sealing us inside. We hear at night that someone was trying to get in and that they requested the aid of a dwarf to help.

We finish a long rest and Otis seems a little more crummy, but the rest of us feel like we're getting over a cold.
