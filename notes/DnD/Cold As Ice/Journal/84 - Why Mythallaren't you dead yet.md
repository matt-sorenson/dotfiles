# 84 - Why Mythallaren't you dead yet?

We discuss potentially dropping a tarrasque on the invading forces – I decide to beseech Tempus for advice. I pose to the mighty lord of battle three questions:

1. Are the invaders putting the world at risk with whatever activities brought them to the mythallar? yes
2. Would it be dishonorable to drop a tarrasque on them? yes
3. Do you think our idea for the fighting arena is dope? Yes

This communion re-energized me with a righteous fury – I was fully prepared at this point to bring the battle to the invaders.

We say the magic word to exit Iriofart-thas' chamber(smokesalvia?) and arrive back in the eight-seated chamber from earlier. I poke my head out the balcony at the south of the room to see a big ominous light coming out of the direction of the mythallar. I load greymond on my shoulders so he can peep a little closer with his magic googles – he says he sees only a couple robed figures sporting only a little bit of chardlyn on them.

We discuss with Professor Mustache the fastest way to get to the Mythallar – and settle on jumping valiantly from this balcony and feather-falling to safety. Ishamel casts his feather fall, I use my scroll and we make our leap – grabbing our nearby iron golem on the way.

We land right in front of the mythallar, finding a bunch of cultists standing around gawking at the thing. A portal has been opened nearby, with Avarice looking on. Four cultists seem to be channeling energy into a shield around avarice – that's not good.

She starts talking shit about Velen doing homework, I threaten to make a necklace out of her teeth. We have a brief discussion with the strangely congenial ice demon lamiach, but he refuses to back down due to his contract with levistis – I'll feel bad when we kill him but at least we'll be giving him the gift of an honorable death.

Suddenly Hirakas lets out a blast of eldritch energy he'd been preparing on the sly – the battle has been joined. Thodurr starts off by spectacularly de-testicularizing a random cultist – a beautiful start to the day. Lamiach takes some swings at Thodurr but they don't seem to accomplish much.

Ishamel's shield guardian fills me with hasty love while Ishamel himself turns Thodurr and Greymond into mighty reptilians – Sharptooth and Graybite! The lizard dwarves take on the ice demon with the help of our golem friend, while me and the robey-boys take on the cultists in the back with the aid of Tempus' mighty celestial representative.

Ishamel messages to let me know that he, the guardian, jesus and velen will rotate around closer to the cultists. The first channeling cultist gets crushed by the celestial – a sure sign of Tempus' favor!

Stupid Avarice tries to stop me and Greybite with a puny ice storm, but we shrug it off and keep rippin' and tearin' our way through the cultists. Our once-headless golem friend earns honorary ball buster status by murdering Lamiach with his big sword – crotch first. If only the amusing ice devil had listened to my warning.

The battle rages on - a little tiefling cleric man shows up during the fray and gets absolutely murdered by Hirakas as one of the cowardly clerics inflicts fatal wounds on my celestial ally. Avarice attempts to cast some sort of spell on me but it sputters out impotently as I sight a distant Ishamel incanting some sort of counter magic – the old man impresses yet again. I ask avarice why she's so bad at magic but she doesn't respond – typical verbal cowardice.

At this point we've mopped up most of the cultist forces, and I've sent the gargoyles back and forth on a fun little jaunt away from the portal(where I've noticed they seem to be chiseling levistis himself out of his fancy-pants ice prison). I call forth another celestial as our dinodwarves continue their rampage, stomping around with bloodied cultists hanging out of their mouths. I'm glad they've having fun – this gleeful carnage is surely bringing Tempus' favor to us all.

Stupid Avarice tries to cast another of her dumb spells as handsome Ishamel yet again squelches it – I close my eyes for a moment and imagine savoring the squelch of her skull caving in from a fierce hammer blow.

Soon we finish off the cultists maintaining Avarice's shield, making it drop – Avarice is vulnerable. Greytooth moves in for a big dino chomp, but narrowly misses due to Avarice having the high ground. His Golem friend joins in on the fun and makes a couple massive chops on Avarice, making her lose concentration on the spell that's holding the portal open. Bye bye levistis, you third rate devil-deity. Tempus flexes on your icy butthole.

Our group begins to descend of Avarice – I'll give her credit, she's tougher than she looks, but it's looking obvious that she's not going to survive this. While I work with Velen and the Shield Guardian to finish off this last armored cultist I decide to Command Avarice to 'Apologize' - causing her to turn to Velen and say 'I'm sorry for being a bitch and looking down on you'.

I'm glad she was able to get that off her chest, because what followed was absolute butchery. The golem savagely chopped at her legs before thodurrsaurus scooped her up into his mouth and started chomping. Jesus followed with a beautifully aimed crossbow bolt, followed by a healthy pummeling from the Shield Guardian and a sacred flame from myself. Avarice was not looking good, but somehow clung to life. Clung to life, that is, until I delivered one final hammer blow to her jaw, knocking the majority of her teeth out. She turns to ice as I pick up her scattered mouthbones – as I stand back up I hear Thodurrsaurus crunch her icy remnants like a fat kid chewing ice out of an empty big gulp.

Now, what to do with this Mythallar?
