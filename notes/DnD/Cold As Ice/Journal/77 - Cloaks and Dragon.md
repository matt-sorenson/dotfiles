# 77 - Cloaks and Dragon

## ðŸ“… 27th of Uktar, 11:31am; Tower of Illusion, bottom floor

Long rest was completed. Stew was consumed.

We go up to the second floor. On this floor is a theater covered in purple lights and rows of comfortable seats. A magical message plays from High Illusionist Ajimar plays, asking us to perform a play from his works. In exchange we would get information pertaining to the Tower of Illusion.

We go up another floor to look for any plays. I check myself out in the mirror at the far end of the room, and notice directly behind me is a wardrobe I didn't notice on the way in. I turn around, but in reality, in its place, was the normal door we entered through. Otis tries to open the wardrobe while looking at the mirror, but it doesn't work: the regular door opens instead.

Next, we investigate the corpse sitting in the chair. Next to it on the table are the text to a play, a spell scroll (Scroll of Illusory Dragon), and a deck of cards (Deck of Illusions).

We spend a long while planning how we might perform this play with the costumes and spells available to us.

We return to the second floor stage and set up for the play. The High Illusionist introduces us, a dozen glowing illusory audience members fill the seats, and we begin.

As the play progresses, all of us slowly become self-conscious of our poor performances. By the end, Otis and I are taken aback by horrible images for a minute before it passes.

The High Illusionist appears again, and seems pleased with our effort regardless. He gives us two pieces of information. First, he gives us a clue how to get to the wardrobe we saw. Second, he gives us a line to the Octad:

Sixth, hide thyself behind a mask.

We go upstairs again, Hirakas uses Invisibility on himself, and reaches out to the mirror. He is able to pass through to a mirrored room on the other side.

In this mirror room, Hirakas can see the wardrobe normally. He opens it and acquires the following:

- Cloak of Displacement
- Cloak of Many Fashions
- Cloak of Billowing
- 100gp worth of jade dust

Hirakas returns through the mirror to the normal room.

We take a short rest to examine the magical items we acquired. I take the Cloak of Displacement, replacing the Psi Crystal I had been carrying. As a result of this, I suddenly feel much different - more aware of how I had been acting the past few tenday. Only now do I realize the crystal had been changing my behavior somewhat.
