# 10 - Big Bone Legs

## ðŸ“… 20th of Marpenoth, 7:14pm

After dealing with the harpies at the entrance to the moaning caves, we decided
to enter via the southern entrance â€“ following the tracks of the missing
fisherpeople. It was icy but our crampons saw us through with excellent
traction.  A ways in we found a frozen waterfall impeding our progress.
Before we attempted to mantle it Hirakas sent Squidface over the top to survey
the area â€“ he said that the ice seemed thin and that there seemed to be liquid
moving beneath.

What followed was not one of my proudest moments â€“ I attempted to climb the
waterfall, but the ice shattered during the attempt and I found myself enveloped
by some sort of living water creature, completely unable to free myself. The
creature bore down on me over and over, my only source of respite being a faint
'you go girl' I heard eminate from Greymond. I'm not sure why he chose those
words specifically, but the sound of a friendly voice was encouraging, if only
for a moment. Eventually I blacked out after receiving a huge blow from the
water monster, but woke up vomiting water â€“ the party had handled the beast
just in time to save me. Ishamael had dragged me to safety and somehow restored
me with his magic â€“ maybe the old man did know a thing or two about healing
after all.

Once that debacle had passed we continued onward â€“ Thodurr snuck down a nearby
tunnel but came back piss-scared about something he could not find the words to
describe well. Something about a 'leggy bone monster' of tremendous size. To me
it sounded like a glorious opportunity to wash the shame of the last 'battle'
from myself, but the others wanted to take our time before engaging it. Hirakas
lead off with some more Squidly scouting, discovering writing that seemed to
detail frost giants dying while in the tub and something about 'Obin'. To be
honest I was not paying too much attention, focused as I was on the imminent
battle with the leggy bone thing.

We eventually made our approach to the bone-thing in formation â€“ upon entering
we realized it was a humongous frost giant skeleton, half-encased in the ice.
Fortunately it's arms were frozen as well, so the creature was defenseless.
We started our attack gingerly for fear of freeing it from the ice, but
eventually we realized it was well stuck and went full bore in an attempt to
kill it before it freed itself. The creature died without even having a chance
to swing its axe â€“ still more glory in this than almost getting drowned after
falling down a ledge. Around the skeleton we found some cloth scraps that seemed
to indicate the remains of the lost fisherpeople â€“ alas, poor Chamantha, you
were not meant for this world.

Hirakas went for another round of scouting with Squidlips, and relayed to us
that he saw a room with more massive skeletons frozen into what must have been
a hot springs at one point â€“ this must be the dead bathing frost giants the
documents had mentioned. He also mentioned that he saw an old lady â€“ perplexing.
She took attention to the familiar and summoned some sort of evil spirit ball
that obliterated poor Squidly in one shot.  We moved forward to engage the
little sprite ourselves, finding it incredibly difficult to land a blow on the
nimble creature. I could sense that this it was the bound spirit of some old
dead thing, and prayed for Tempus to inspire an unnatural fear in the heart of
the wisp. It was a fast bugger too â€“ it took off at great speed, and we did not
see it again. Pressing forward let us get a better glimpse of the woman's
face â€“ she was not just an old lady but some sort of twisted vile hag, with
huge chompy teeth. I had to steel myself against the very sight of the creature,
nevertheless feeling a sense of dread that I couldn't quite put to the back of
my mind.

The hag proved difficult to kill, as it was hiding behind this large, solid
metal cauldron filled with some sort of vile stew.  The cauldron made for
extremely effective cover. We flailed for a time before Greymond, in a fit of
inspiration, upturned the cauldron and doused the hag in her stew. This
dislodged her from her place of cover and allowed us to finish her off, with
Hiraka's final blast knocking her corpse right into the cauldron.

Inspecting the cauldron and its upturned contents showed that the hag had been
cooking some sort of people stew â€“ I could pick out a few individual fingers
and most of a foot mixed in with the vegetables on the ground. The cauldron had
been flipped completely over during the battle, but upon removal of the hag's
corpse we saw that a healthy amount of stew had pooled in the bottom. Unlike
the stew that had spilled on the ground, this fresh stew seemed to be devoid of
conspicuous people meat. It almost seemed as if the vessel itself was
generating the stew â€“ this intrigued us enough to inspire an experiment. We
emptied the cauldron again, this time very thorough-like, and then poured in a
little bit of water in as well. Before our eyes the water darkened and bubbled,
cooked vegetables floating in from seemingly nowhere.  This would be quite
useful on our journeys, especially given the abundance of snow covering this
forsaken wastes of a land. I also found some sort of old hoodoo bag on the
witch â€“ this I pocketed, rolled up in the rancid zombie clothes I had held onto
for reasons I cannot remember.

As we were leaving the room I noticed a scrap of skin on the floor â€“ human skin
tattooed with the name 'chamantha' - conclusive proof to the end of the
fisherfolk. Winding down, we found a room with some boring mineral deposits
that the dwarves were attracted to, constantly lusty for rocks as they are.
Their fascination passed quickly, their attention passing to some crude
drawings of giants drowning themselves. We checked one last room on our way
out, finding a large and angry wolf snapping at us. With some quick thinking I
tossed the rancid Yeti Tyke had that had been in my bag for days, and the dog
went for the bait and was distracted. We backed out carefully â€“ Thodurr wanted
a chance to talk to the beast so we dicked around while he did his weird ritual
thing. He want in but quickly left, looking dejected â€“ seems the dog did not
want to be his friend.
