# 46 - Otis and Zardarok sitting in a tree

After some debate we decide that a short rest is probably a good idea before pressing on.  Before we do so Greymond went to check the unopened door to the south of us and found four of them awful fungus bears lying in wait.  Fortunately greymond and thodurr were in position in front of the door- they hold the line while we pummeled them from safety.

I deftly summoned another Mr. Kitty out of my sack of tricks behind the line and it bit the shit out of the stupid wolf bear thing.  Mr. Kitty II fought valiently but was ultimately destroyed by the dumb dog things.  Thodurr stood there trying to dodge instead of just attacking the things, but wasn't doing a great job at it.  He eventually decides to pull his axe out and then makes short work of the beasts.

We finally take that short rest and feel slightly reinvigorated - the fungus man shuffles up and waves his arm at us â€“ what a friendly boy.

We come up with a plan - I would morph into mushroom ale grandma, and infiltrate zardarok's chambers while maintaining mind talk with ishamael.  I pick up some growdwarf armor, a warpick and a heavy crossbow for my disguise.

As we approach the next chamber we see zardarok down below, doing some hooplah with a magic  looking gauntlet.

I enter the next room and witness four growdwarfs trying to maintain control over a hooded beast - they call it an umberhulk.  In disguise I retreat to the back of the room and observe.  I talk mentally with Ishamel and he uses his mindpowers to free the beast, as I identify and make contact with a mushroom ale lover and ask him to protect me.

The beast made short work of its jailers, and seemed to have some effect on those standing near it.  I haard thodurr call out from the hallway, alerting the dwarves in the throne room that the umber hulk was loose.  More dwarves burst through the gate to the next room, and I hear Zardarok call out.  I made my way over to him, letting the party know via Ishamel what's going on.  I tell him that the men who killed his son are here.

More dwarves funnel into the umberhulk killbox, and I see none return.  Zardarok seems mighty sweet on me - he wants to take me back to 'my' chambers.  I agree - I figure at the very least it'll clear him out of the previous room while my friends cleave their way through.

Zardarok takes me into what appears to be an altar - there is a mutilated mind flayer chained to a statue of a Duergar woman.  I ask him about the flayer - he says not to mind it and that 'you know what the flayers mean to crumplethar', and I do not argue.

We stand at the altar and he prays - before looking at his gauntlet with a perturbed look on his face.  He turns to me, eyeing me suspiciously, and asks me where my room is.  Knowing the jig is up, I aim a swift at his nards and fucking bail, running back in the direction of my friends
