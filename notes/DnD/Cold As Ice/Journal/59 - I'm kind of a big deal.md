# 59 - I'm kind of a big deal

## ðŸ“… 20th of Uktar, 10:00am

We make land and head out towards lonelywood, we hike through the day and arrive at lonelywood around noon the next day.

Entering the town we hear loud crack noises from the lake, sounds like the lake is starting to thaw

The town seems livelier than usual.

Krintas is in the street with paper yelling like a mad man. As we approach him he notices us and tells us to follow. He holds a copy of the map from the contract between the moose & the speaker. Apparently some folk are trying to cut trees from the moose's side of the woods but krintas is scaring them from doing so.

The speaker sees us and runs back to her house and returns with cookies in our shape, she asks what happened as she's sure we caused the change in weather, we tell her we killed Auril (& lots of other creatures). She seems speechless for a bit, she tells us everyone suspects it's us and our tavern has been busy. She tells us she'll be running to the other towns to spread the word but Ishamael volunteers to take a note to Bryn Shander and have them sound out the notice.

Ishamael suggests we get some land to build a fighting pit.

A crowd has formed during our discussion and Otis riles them up by telling them Auril said lonelywood sucks.

After much discussion we head towards the talking moose.

Copper is extremely happy to see us.

We boast about our adventures, discuss that I was born from an egg.

Ishamael seems to want to hatch the dragon and raise it as a pet.

The group opens up a chest and some sort of monster appears and attacks our mooseman. Thodurr quickly destroys it and Otis finds some sort of light emitting bow (translators note: laser pistol) without a string in its prison pocket and gives it to sahnar to use to protect the inn in case a crowd gets to rowdy. We set copper to start breaking down our giant bird and we help him move it to the back.

We go to the smith and get the giant elk reigns and Thodurr gets a mini barrel.

Otis makes a stew with his parts of auril, it tastes good and others eat some. Thodur for his part takes a jug and pores a bunch of honey into his new barrel.

At some point Nimzy gave us the note to give to the speaker in Bryn Shander

Otis decides to ask tempest some questions, he's just not sure which questions and decides to crowd source it.

- Did you witness the battle with auril? yes
- Is auril really dead? no
- Is auril coming back? unsure

We hang out the rest of the day, and sleep for the night.

Ishameal talks to the egg and feels it., valyn is asked about dragons and can apparently also speak draconic and claims to know about dragons.

We leave for bryn shander and get there without any event.
