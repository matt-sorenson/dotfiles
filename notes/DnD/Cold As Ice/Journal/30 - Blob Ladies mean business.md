# 30 - Blob Ladies mean business

## ðŸ“… 5th of Uktar, 17:26

The lights go out in the prison and we hear a commotion in the distance.  I hear Hirakas try and doodle up some magic but nothing happens â€“ in response I light up my shield so we can see what happens.  The warden says 'this isn't supposed to happen' before trying to open the exit door â€“ it won't budge.  She utters the word 'maristo' - turning the room red, but leaving the door closed.  She says it again, room red again.  I'm a little incredulous at the fact the door won't open â€“ she says there's an arcane lock spell that SHOULD be granting her free access.

Having recently learned to dispel magic, I ask if that will work â€“ she answers to affir mative so I take a shot.  Casting the spell makes the door unlock with a CLICK â€“ Greymond sticks his head out to see what's going on.  Through the open door we hear complaints about piss and shitwater, and loud complaining directed towards the guards.  A guard comes up to us and asks if we're okay â€“ he seems as clueless as we are, but says something is on the fritz.   I call the warden out but she is in a SORRY state â€“ she says she'll go take a look and see what the deal is.  We leave the guard with prisoner 237(wuzzisname) and move forward.

As we head into the central area of the prison we see that the piss and shitwater has indeed spread EVERYWHERE.  I ask Hirakas if he's able to clean this up the way he handled 237's pants, but this mess is just too much for him to handle that easily.  The warden walks through the shitwater to talk to the guard in the guard station in the central area â€“ he apologizes for the situation and asks if we want ot make ourselves comfortable while they sort the situation out.

As we debate the situation a dirty blond, middle aged human woman rolls up and says 'Ishamael?'  He says she's familiar, but can't quite remember who she is â€“ she says her name is Katherine.  She says 'It's taken weeks to piece things together', further confusing Ishamael.  She asks to talk in private, but Ishamael is still confused.  She asks him whether he remembers what happened to them, and if he remembers the ship â€“ Ishamael responds that he remembers his two little girls.  She says that Ishamael was in 'the container next to his' and that they used to talk whenever 'they' were gone.  She asks to move somewhere more private â€“ we head towards the hospital wing on the warden's suggestion.  Finding ourselves unable to open the door, and myself out of Tempus juice to dispel the lock.   We just loiter outside the hopsital ward while Ishamael and Katherine walk around the corner to talk.

*conversation that otis didn't hear*

Ishamael only remembers his name, his daughters, not much else â€“ names are fuzzy

Katherine says she's not sure that's even her name

She had the same thought of 'daughters', but doesn't think they were human or really her children â€“ says they were smaller than human.

She remembers the ship â€“ Ishamael doesn't.  She asks 'you don't remember those bald-headed purple-skinned creatures?  With the weird tentacles coming out of their mouths.'

Does Hirakas count as 'bald?'  Question for later

Back to topic of small children, Ishamael asks â€“ dwarves, gnomes?  Something about the big ones 'hasting' them, the smaller ones being less likely to.

She says that as time went on she was more able to understand 'them', but doesn't have a name.

Ishamael is still a complete blank â€“ besides his children.

She asks if his mind is sharper than before â€“ no, he's very forgetful.

She thinks all the captives were magic users â€“ Katherine, Ishamael, 2 others.

Asks if he's improving his magic â€“ he is, but doesn't really understand it.

Only other wizards he knows are Danica the jingus girl and the dude burned at the stake.

She asks what's the most powerful thing he can do â€“ he says he can move things with his mind and she gets weird about it.  Ishamael tries to suss her out, but she turns into some kind of red blob and engulfs him.  Gets a brain massage but is able to shake it off â€“ hears words in his mind 'Oh, that's too bad'

*Otis Pov*

Can't really hear jack shit from their conversation, just a few random words â€“ crash, magic, purple.  All of a sudden we see Ishamael pop out from around the corner - 'I could use a little help here...' Before casting a spell of some sort.  Thodurr rushes forward, ripping the dagger from his hair without flinching â€“ truly disgusting.  As I round the corner myself, Greymond rushes to meet the threat.  I prepare myself to throw sacred flame at whatever foul creature has beset Ishamael.  Hirakas warps himself in front of me, and sends a magic blast down around the corner.  I hear a vicious shriek come around the corner.  I grow anxious at the thought of what kind of creature we're up against before noticing a subtle shimmer attempt to slip by meâ€“ I have been preparing for this moment for days.  I yell 'eat shit grow dorf' and attempt to smite the tiny freak, but it skitters by despite my efforts.

I round the corner and ask about the dwarf â€“ they claim it was Katherine, and that she wasn't a grow dwarf at all.   Ishamael fills us in on the conversation they had, said that she knew him and something about purple capsule tentacles. Ishamael say katherine turned red, angry and blobby before getting hit once and shrieking away all invisible like.

Thodurr says the blobby lady read his mind and it made him sad?  I'm having issues deciding what's happening â€“ this is the real thodurr, we did a mead test.   We decide to check in with the warden to see if she knows what the deal was with Katherine.  She says she was too drunk to remember who we were talking to, and the guards aren't any help.  We decide to take a look at their visitor log to see if the name 'Katherine' comes up, but the Warden isn't willing to let us â€“ saying the name doesn't ring a bell to her, as either guard or visitor.  We head back to the conference room to discuss the situation.  The warden doesn't believe us when we tell her that the red blobby lady hurt Thodurrs brain feelings.  We offer to demonstrate, first on Thodurr and then on Marta or one of her guards.  Thodurr takes it first, to see if it feels the same as his previokus assault â€“ he says it does.  After witnessing it, Marta offers up one of her guards to take the attack â€“ a bold looking one steps forward.  Ishamael gets him with the mind sliver â€“ after scrunching his face for a second, the guard looks up in terror, yelling 'Get back, these people aren't who you think they are.'   Greymond walks to the guard and asks what his deal is, they guy says something about them making him do things he doesn't want to do.  The Warden spouts some sort of gibberish before turning into a red blobby form and enveloping Ishamaels head briefly - it crawls off him shortly after and the old man comes out looking in a sorry state.

Hirakas takes a blast at the blob lady, then Thodurr steps forward, ripping the dagger yet again out of his hair â€“ a sickening noise.  He attempts to hit fake Marta, but misses embarassingly.  Ishamael brain zaps another guard, and it seems to snap him out of his trance right quick.  One of the guards by the door steps up and attempts to strike me, missing but angering me in the process.  His friend tries to stop him, but is unable to contain his brain controlled comrade.  Greymond steps forward and punches Marta right in the face twice, whooping her.  The little wizard feller steps forward and zaps the guard in front of me before skittering away himself, all brave like.

Thodurr grabs the slimy girl and Ishamael reaches into his bag and pulls out a small furry object, throwing it on the ground where it turned into an enormous elk filling the room and knocking ishamael and a guard out of the way.  Greymond moves across the room to whoop on the guard being mean to me, but as I look back I realize fake Marta is gone â€“ a tether of slime is now in Thodurr's hands where he was once grappling Marta, and I see it snake out of the roomm through the door.  I attempt to command the slime and the guard near me to 'return', hoping it would cause her to re-enter the room.  I blink again and slowly realize that there are two Ishamaels in the room.  The new Ishamael is still slightly attached to Thodurr â€“ he does the weird blob morph thing before he slaps at Thodurr's hands, but the hairy dwarf holds fast.  He ends up running circles around fake Ishamael, wrapping up the slime in the slime all while still holding the lime of slime firmly in his meaty, smelly hands.  One of the guards runs away, buts get mind zapped by Ishamael, resulting in his snapping out of his trance but still continuing to return â€“ to the barracks in this case.  Ishamael orders the moose to stomp himself â€“ this sends a sickening ripple down the slime line, and before we realize what happens a bunch of random people fly into the room via the slime line, each exploding in a pile of red goo.  Eventually, the main body of this bizzarre creature hauls itself into the room, still held tight by Thodurr, and explodes in a big shower of disgusting, chunky red goop.
