# 54 - Youth In Asia

## ðŸ“… 17th of Uktar, 10:59am; Island of Solstice

We head towards the skull castle.

Nass & Ishamael discuss her hook hand.

We debate taking a rest for Otis to rest as he's magically spent.

We decide to just go in.

We know the book we're looking for is in a dark room, the room has a dome ceiling and there's 2 statues of women guardians, the book is on a pedestal/lectern. We ask Nass if she can sense how many we stand to face, she says theirs some not dead/not alive giants

When we reach the large doors at the skull castle, the doors appear to be made of ice

Thodurr slowly opens the left door, grey has trouble trying to open his door

Inside Thodurr & Red open a door exposing an ice giant.

I can't understand what he and thodurr say but he doesn't seem all there and stands up and swings his sword and misses by a mile, after more shouting I still don't know what they're saying.

Thodurr grabs a knife and approaches the giant, the giant swings and hits thodurr quite strongly.

Thodurr got some info that Auril is upstairs

He asks us to kill him in battle, Otis & Thodurr agree and start to fight him. After a short battle he's dead and we investigate his treasure* room  and find

373 Gold 6 Silver each

4 gold rings sized for giants (150gp each)

1 shield for giant made from dragon scales, impressive but worthless

2ft tall, 50lbs statue of thrim, frost giant god made of ice

We continue down the hallway and another door is opened, curtis takes a giant tankard. Nass thinks it's downstairs

We carefully head down the slippery stairs, we see a giant tusked seal sliding about smacking into walls and bouncing. There's apparently some sort of test down here for working with auril. There's apparently also 2 skeletal beings to our north.

We approach the door to the south that appears to hold the book we're looking for and Ishamael casts some super load spell trying to unlock the door, it fails and after a lot of discussion we try the door to the north were we find 2 frost giant skeletons and we battle them.

We kill the giants pretty easily, one red finally opens the door we find a giant axe, 15ft tall & stupidly heavy,

Closing the door to the room and taking a rest
