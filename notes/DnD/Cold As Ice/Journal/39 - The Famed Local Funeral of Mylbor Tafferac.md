Otis starts looting the corpses and finds

- 34g â€“ Split, remainder in party treasure

Me & Thodurr moved the bodies outside and we discussed what to do with the chardalyn, we decide to go to the dwarven valley to see if we can offload it.

After a couple hours we arrive at the dwarven valley and head towards the forges. I go in with graymond and we ask about the chardalyn. The dwarf grey leads us to told us to get rid of it and told us about a dwarf who went mad after using it, after some discussion we decide to dump the chardalyn in some dudes grave/locked hall to keep it from the dark dwarves.

Grey & the dwarf open several heavy doors, and the dwarf tells us it's been a decade since it was last opened. We bring in the cart and dump the weapons. When we leave, we discuss buying weapons with the unnamed dwarf, he takes us to a store room and the others go in deeper for a better look, I stay near the entrance as I don't need such weapons.

After those deals are made we travel to the smithy for some more mundane weapon trades, we unload a bunch of crappy weapons and pick up a few before heading out.

We arrive at brynn shander to turn in the 'red yeti' and return the corpse of Famed Local Hunter Mylbor Tafferac, after getting past the guards we go to the northlook where otis unceromoniously places Famed Local Hunter Mylbor Tafferac on a table and with scramsacks attention we show him the 'red yeti'. We go with scramsacks to burn Famed Local Hunter Mylbor Tafferac and the beasts body. Scramsax pays us for killing the beast, 60g each. We load the creature back into the wagon along with Famed Local Hunter Mylbor Tafferac and traveled outside the city to burn him in a pyre.
