# 47 - The Death of Xardorock

We began today with Hirakus, Greymond, Ishamael, and I passing the time waiting for Otis's signal to begin attacking the forces of Xardorock. We heard lots of fighting with a giant creature on the other side of the door, obviously Otis is doing a great job whittling down the forces of Xardorock.

FINALLY, Otis gives us the signal to begin our final attack against Xardorock. When we exited the hallway we were hiding in, we entered a chamber full of dead Duagar, remnants of the large fight we heard while hiding.

Hirakus had an angle on Xardorock, so he unleashed two of his famous blasty things against him. Xardorock mentioned that we have another individual that is gifted with powers from a god.

As I was holding Otis's weapons, I walked up to him and gave him his gear. Greymond and I then stood by the door that opens to the other chamber that Xardorock was in, ready to face this monster. We hear Xardorock on the other side of the door, calling in more of his Duagar.

Before we begin our assault Otis blessed three or us. Ishamael asks Greymond and I if we want to be transformed into a creature. Greymond was hesitant but I immediately volunteered, I'm already all furry, this is a normal day for me.

Before I open the door to Xardorocks chamber, I turn around to the crew and yell, "For Mushroom Ale" and as I open the door, Ishamael cast a spell on me, transforming me into a GIANT APE!!!

My transformation catches Xardorock and his Duagar by surprise, I move forward and immediately pummel a Duagar to death, this giant ape power is amazing. Death to the Duagar!

The rest of the crew begins to filter through the door, at the same time, Xardorock's forces begin jumping down from their watch towers and enlarge themselves to fight us.

Greymond makes his way to the stairway of one of the watch towers, as Giant Ape me takes on Xardorock and the bulk of his forces. Some of the duagar attempted to throw fire and acid pots at me, but most missed. I attempted to throw a giant rock at Xardorock, but his strength and shield deflected my massive rock. Slowly I began pummeling the duagar around me, one by one.

As more of the Duagar joined the fight, I started noticing that some were turning on their fellow duagar, thank god for the Mushroom ale movement.

Our crew fought valiantly against Xardorocks forces. Greymond fully took over a watch tower, with the help of a mushroom ale duagar ally. Otis and Ishamael, mostly drained from our earlier engagements, supported us from behind as much as they could as they looked for more invisible duagar and summoning their spirit sword thingy to aid us in battle.

Hirakus was fully focused on Xardurock, summoning his henticle friend and launching several of his blasty things on Xardorock. Pretty sure Hirakus was only seeing blood as he forgot that we needed Xardorock alive to try and stop this giant dragon of death because he ended up slaying Xardorock with one of his blasty thingys.

Right after killing Xardorock, Hirakus orders the remaining duagar to surrender,  Xardurock is dead. One duagar asked if we will kill them, Hirakus told them no as long as they drop their weapons.

I really wanted to pummel the duagar that landed an acid pot on me, but I overcame my animalistic rage and let him go surrender. Out of the shadows appeared a couple more machine like duagar, I didnâ€™t think we have any chance of negotiating with them. So, giant ape me moves forward to eradicate them.

Some of the remaining duagar start to surrender. Ishamael needed to message one of the duagar directly to surrender again, but after the stern reminder, they backed off and joined the other surrendering duagar. Greymond shot a warning shot to another aggressive duagar and Otis ordered them to drop their weapon and go to the wall, to which they complied.

After all the metal duagar were disposed of and the remaining normal duagar surrendered, Ishamael tells me it is over, so I pounded my giant ape chest and let out a roar of victory.

Ishamael then tells me to wait while they interrogate the duagar, since we may need the giant ape power again.

Ishamael and Otis begin interrogating the defeated duagar. They tell us that they aren't sure how to stop the dragon. Xardorock was the only one that could get the dragon to begin it assault, and that it had to do with the Shardlin glass gauntlet on xardurock.

Ishamael started to reach out for the gauntlet but started feeling a very warm and angry sensation come over him, touching it you feel hatred. So he backed off from grabbing the gauntlet and instead, Otis used some old duagar clothing to pick up the gauntlet by wrapping it in the clothing.

Ishamael and Otis both tried to determine what this gauntlet was using their religion connection, but they were only able to feel a dark unholy presence coming from the guantlet.

Otis asked the duagar what would happen if we destroy the heart thingy, they stated that this is how the dragon was created and they think the gauntlet controls the dragon.

We consider trying to wear the gauntlet but feign away from it due to concerns that it will make us crazy.

Ishamael askes the duagar where Xardorock worshipped his deity, they pointed us to another chamber. Before making our way to the chamber, Ishamael returned me to my normal form, then Otis tied Xardorocks dead body to a rope and then my foot so I could drag his body along.

We go the chamber the duagar pointed us to and in it we found a very malnourished mind flayer with all of its face tentacles chopped off chained to some strange statue. The mind flayer begged Ishamael and Otis to end its suffering and kill him.

Ishamael ignores his request and ask the mind flayer if he has read Xardorocks mind and if he knows how he controlled the dragon. The mind flayer told us that he did take a peak before, but something else was in his mind, this other presence was the source of Xardorocks power.

The mind flayer also told us that Xardorock would just come to this statue and talk to it.

Ishamael asked Greymond to procure one of the dead duagar bodies so the mind flayer could get some nutrition, greymond complies. Ishamael warns the mind flayer against any bad intentions and tells him we have not had good history with their kind.

The mind flayer asks us if we are aware of the relationship between the duagar and the mind flayers. I sorta remember being told while growing up that the mind flayers pissed off some of the duagars and there is retribution to be paid. I share this with the crew.

We release the mind flayer from his chains and he asks us to bash in the duagars face so he could get to the brains, otis complied.

While consuming the brain, the mind flayer asked us if we are xardorocks foe, to which we said yes. He points us to another room in the back that Xardorock talks to something.

We begin to move to this back room where we see a duagar which seems to be wearing some priest gown of some sort. He turns to us and says, "the ball busters I presume?" This duagar asks us if we have slain Xardorock, which we tell him we did. He ask if the body is outside of the door, again, we tell him yes.

Ishamael asks if he knows how to stop the dragon, this priest says he won't make it easy, knows us for busting all the balls. We threaten to bust his balls. I move forward to manacle him, but as I reach forward, my hand goes through his robe and I hit a spike instead, his rob is some sort of illusion. I scream out that his robe is an illusion and combat ensues.

We all begin attacking what ever this creature is with our many weapons, notably Ishamael uses his chill touch hand on this creatures balls, but it has zero effect to this creatures testicles but a hat falls off of this creature and the robes disappear and a weird spike creature appears instead. Around the same time, another of the same creatures shows up behind Otis and attacks him, then moves behind Ishamael. Otis had a strange sensation and knew that these creatures were devils.

Seeing Ishamael in trouble and knowing the rest of the crew will be able to take care of the first badly injured spike creature, I rushed over to him and flank this new spike creature that arrived.

We attempted to knock these creatures out instead of killing them, but as we were just about to knock the first one out, a cloud of smoke would appear, covering them, then as the smoke would clear, we could see a portal leading to somewhere very hot.

We made quick work of the second spiked devil and when we were about to knock it out, again, it turned into a cloud of smoke and escape via the same portal mechanic.

After the spike creatures disappeared, Otis looted the hat of disguise from the first spiked devil. We also see a bunch of tablets to read, but no one knew the language so Hirakus has the ability to comprehend languages, we wait 10 minutes so he can use this ability.

As Hirakus reads the tablets he learns and shares that they are a manifesto. Tells us we see two names, one being deepdura, but this maybe a fake god? Another being Asmodeus, which turns out to be the deity that Xardorock was communicating with. Otis seems familiar with this Asmodeus guy.

Hirakus continues telling us that Asmodeus is the king devil god of the ream he is from, some fire realm place that has 9 levels, but Asmodeus is ruler of these 9 levels. All of the evil deeds we have seen today are a result of Asmodeus.

All I know, I hate this Asmodeus guy and can't wait to bash his balls in.
