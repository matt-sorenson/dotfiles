# 14 - Pot Cartel trying to keep us down

## ðŸ“… 22nd of Marpenoth, 14:07

We go to Rendarils for Ishmael and Otis to get some oil. We then head to the stables to get our dogs and head to the northlook to sell our meat & mead.

Sold the pyritron for 20gp and the crag cat meat for 1gp and the remaining goat meat for 7gp

ThodÃ¼rr sold a barrel of mead for 30gp

Scramsax offered to purchase the man eating moose if we kill it.

We head out towards Targos.

As we're on the road to Targos we see four individuals that form a blocking the road. They appear to be trying to steal the pot from us.

After throwing acid at 3 of them Ishmael is attacked and severely injured. I manage to kill the leader with my tentacle, Otis' spiritual weapon is able to take another one out, red takes out 1 that dropped it's weapon for some reason and Otis knocks out the last one.

While searching them we find a sigil in the shape of a flying snake which is a symbol used by Zhentarim. An organization interested in controlling goods and services being sold.

Interrogate the survivor, he doesn't know much, we send him off mostly naked

We leave the bodies on the side of the road and continue on to Targos arriving soon after.

We arrive at Targos and return to Keagan to check on Garret.  Get our Scrimshaw, and they offer us a roof for the night.
