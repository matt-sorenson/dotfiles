# 62 - The Forgotten City of the Netherese

## ðŸ“… 24th of Uktar, 8:45

I wake up in our Lonelywood tavern to eat some breakfast, while eating, Ishamael passionately starts explaining and drawing sketches of the vault and arena we want built. Copper eyes seemed to glaze over with the amount of details Ishamael had, hopefully he is able to put it all together to make what is needed.

Reference Dwarf Fortress Mock ups for more details in the notes to the right ->

Shenar mentioned telling the Villigers that the dwarves were in charge of the excavation and that Krintas would order people around.

After some silence, Velin spoke up to remind us agreeing to help her find a forgotten city that hasn't been visited for a 1000 years. Ishamael ask her if the city will be upside down, to which Velin says, it may be. Then Otis and Ishamael start a very long worthless conversation about flipping the city the right way up... I worry they are going senile with age.

After a very long stupid conversation about flipping a city.... Velin reads some rhyme with information of where to find the city. Apparently we will find the city behind some frozen waterfall that is broken open at a glacier. We agree to begin this new journey, so Velin whips her kobolds to get them moving.

We proceed to travel 11 hours to the east towards the Reghed glacier, then head north for another few hours, finally arriving at an immense blue wall that seems impenetrable, but we see something that looks like an ice fissure and we hear rumbling coming from it.

We leave the kobolds to guard the animal caravan near the entrance to the ice fissure, Otis uses his bag of tricks to have a panther added to protect our animals. I also feed the dogs some fish.

We enter the fissure, after a few steps in, we hear echoing sounds like hyenas. After a brief walk through the initial corridors, Hirakus notices a fire, mentions it to the crew but he wasn't quiet, and out came a floating skull that was on fire.

We swiftly destroy the first flaming skull with Hirakus, Ishamael and I blasting and slicing it to bone dust. I enter a corridor where I see more light from fire, but as I near the end of the corridor, I encounter three new flaming skulls. I throw a javalin at one, but they look ready to burn my wonderful fur.

Two of the skulls focus me but the last one goes to emit a massive fireball on the rest of the crew. Otis walks into the corridor and cast some spell that makes them all run away from him, then summons his spiritual sword to attack them. Greymond joins us and quickly destroys another one of the skulls.

Ishamael lights up the whole area, Hirakus attacks another one of the skulls and I move away from a fiery circle that a one of the skulls cast below me and throw another javelin at another flaming skull. Otis tries to warn to not attack it, but I don't understand why and proceed to attack anyways, but I soon learn. Hitting that creature caused his spell that made them run away, wear off. It proceeded to hit our whole crew with another massive fireball, my poor fur, I owe Otis some mead for that.

Otis moves towards another skull and together with his spiritual weapon, he destroys another skull. Then Greymond destroys the remaining last skull.

Hirakus takes one of the skulls and asks professor Mustache if this is the skull of a netherese, he confirms it. There was also a broken down sky coach, which Professor mustache tells us was used for flying around the city.

We find a metal chest in the debris, which had some weird language that only Hirakus could understand. Ishamael uses some loud knocking spell on the chest, which echos throughout the cavern and we hear hyenas in the distance again.

In the chest we find a bag of holding, some jewels, and a ring. The group distributed the loot among the crew.

We rest up in this corridor as the skulls did a real number on us, partly my fault, but I guess I learned my lesson to listen to Otis next time.

While resting Greymond discovered that the ring is magical and can be used to do some ranged magical attacks.

We begin searching more of the corridors but find nothing. We then walk down some stairs to find an emaciated kobold with glowing red eyes and elongated fangs, it hisses at us and runs away.

As we go further, we see an entrance to a chamber with large icicles above us, if porcupine butts castle taught us anything, those may not be icicles. Hirakus looks closely to find that some of the icicles are not what they seem. With that knowledge in hand, Ishamael launches a fireball at the ceiling, killing a lot of these ice creatures immediately. They seem to burst when they die.

One of the creatures survives but Otis and Hirakus make quick work of it.

Again, I worry Ishamael is going senile or maybe all that brain that got eaten is getting to him. He starts asking if a pillar has a chest in it... Velin asks him if is fucking stupid, but Ishamael proceeds to look over the pillar very carefully anyways, to find nothing... Maybe it's time to start finding him a retirement home.

On one side of the chamber was what looked like an old stone tower, Otis looks through a small hole in the tower to see a skeleton on the floor. He uses his stone magic ability to make the hole in the tower bigger, allowing us to climb through.

As we enter the room in the tower, the crew feels a good magical effect upon them, which professor mustache clarifies that the tower was used for rejuvenating magic and the effects seem to still be working.

On the skeleton is a necklace with some star symbol. Otis recognizes it as the symbol of Mystrl, the former goddess of the weave.

Velin tells us that Mystryl used to be the goddess of the weave, but some asshole did something that caused her to be destroyed, which caused all magic to stop working for a bit. This caused all the Netherese floating city's to fall down. She was then reborn as Mystra, the current goddess of the weave.

Otis opens up another crack on the other side of the tower so we can pass through. We make our way down another corridor to find a slab covered in frost. We decide to open and find writing that Professor mustache tells us is the language of the Netherese. The professor tells us that we can press the eye character to take a tour, to which Otis does.

Otis tells us his vision was completely taken away to see the way the city was before, with a big green place within a circular city with ovalish sections.

After the tour, we exit the room to go into another room with a large iron face on the floor. The eyes on the face are glowing and then start turn on and off.

The group tries to communicate with the face, but it doesn't seem to understand us. We turn to Professor mustache who tells us this used to be an iron golem who protected the city in the past and they speak a specific language called Loras, which he can speak.

We use the professor to translate for us and Ishamael and Otis begin asking yes or no questions by having the golem blink once for yes, twice, for no, and three times for he doesn't know.

They ask the following questions:

Has anything been through here but us? One blink, yes.
If it knows what a Tiefling is? One blink, yes.
If it has seen a Tiefling come through here? Two blinks no.
If a human has come through here? Two blinks, no.
If a creature came through here? One blink, yes.
Asks if the city is upside down? Three blinks, don't know.
Does it perceive us as friendly? One blink, yes.
I shake my head as Ishamael ask if it requires any auditing? Two Blinks, no
Do you have any pockets? Two blinks, no
Any treasure not in pockets? Two blinks, no.
Anyway to take you with us? Three blinks, doesn't know.
Do you want to get out of here? It blinks once.

We make an agreement to rescue the statue when we are ready to leave the city.
