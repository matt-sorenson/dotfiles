# 53 - Ghosts Ahead

## ðŸ“… 17th of Uktar, 9:12am; Island of Solstice

A ghost from the frozen corpse suddenly appears in front of us and starts yelling at Otis, asking why we cut off her head. Otis defends his actions but seemingly makes the ghost even more mad.

I change the topic and ask why she was out here alone, and the ghost claims she also came with a band of pirates. We spot the ship down below, off the 50 ft cliff. I then question how she died, and apparently it was just from exposure to the cold. Anybody out here adventuring should at least know how to dress for the weather. It seems suspicious, but at the same time, she sounds very naÃ¯ve.

We try to decide what to do, but ultimately leave the decision up to her. We take the head and the body with us just in case.

We take some time to climb down the cliff to the pirate ship to see what was left on board, if anything. We notice frozen corpses on board, and start beheading them just in case. It's a good thing we did, because they start to raise up.

Before we know it, a dozen undead corpses appear from different rooms and start rushing toward us. I get completely surrounded but have no trouble holding my own against the dead. Surprisingly, ThodÃ¼rr gets paralyzed by one of the ghouls and is taken out of combat. They keep coming for what feels like forever, but we succeed in killing all the ghouls without sustaining any damage (apart from ThodÃ¼rr's ego).

Upon searching all of the crates, we find the following:

- 400gp
- 800sp
- 4 Ã— 25gp jewelry

We also find:

- 2 peg legs
- 1 pirate hook

We climb our way back up the cliffside and ask Vellynne to reanimate Nass' old body. She successfully conducts the spell, and Nass possesses her old body, which allows her to travel further than she was able to to previously. We also give the pirate hook to Nass to cover up the broken hand.

Next session: Travel to the castle and try to retrieve the item.
