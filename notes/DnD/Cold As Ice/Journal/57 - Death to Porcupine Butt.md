# 57 – Death to Porcupine Butt

Why the hell am I in this forsaken castle trying to kill some god? First this bitch goddess is teleporting around the room and my short stubby legs can't reach her, now she is a giant ice thingy and they want me to kill it?

Oh to add on to this craziness, now two of these crazy people are giant apes, hurling rocks around like it’s a normal day, what a weird crew.

All I know is this Ishamael guy slapped me across the face, so if I want to avoid getting slapped again, might as well do what he says and help kill this bitch.

As I make my way towards the giant Ice lady, while walking past the large stone dude who was protecting Ishamael earlier, he just turned around and punches me twice, he hit me right in the nose, I'm pretty sure its broken.

I turned and yelled at Ishamael, "what the fuck, why is your stone dude attacking me," he seems just as confused.

One of the apes seeing this stone dude attack me, attacks the stone dude, seems like this stone guys betrayal was a surprise to everyone.

As the others continue fighting the Ice bitch, Ishamael comes up to me and gives me a nice heal, but that does little to quitch this anger that is growing inside of me, all I wanna do is smash my axe into that frozen bitch so I can be done with this insane situation.

Without warning, the ice bitch turns and faces the hallway and does a massive cone ice attack, hitting me gravely, and disabling the stone dude and the giant elk behind me. Everyone looks to have taken a massive hit from her, I feel like I am about to fall unconscious but I shake that off and start to see red, pure red rage.

I embrace the rage and charge at this ice bitch right as the other dwarf deals a massive slice with his sword, I go to the other side of him and deal my first massive axe blow with a final roar in her face.

Everyone begins wailing on this ice giant, we know we can't survive another blow like the one earlier, finally, one of the crew that was a monkey and is now a human again, Otis I think was his name, does a massive killing blow right in the crotch. She shatters into many crystal pieces, and right we thought this was over, the crystal pieces start to reform into a very cold crystal. Otis yells, shatter her.

This new crystal lets out a very bright light, I can't see a thing. Not sure what happened next, I hear commotion around me, so I assume they are still attacking this crystal, but something happened to me that made me feel like I could run for ever. I blindly attack in front of me, but nothing connects. I hear more commotion but its further away, and what sounds like someone collapsing to the floor, then I start to feel the opposite from before and begin to nod off like a forced nap was upon me.

After almost blacking out for a bit, I finally regain my eye sight and start catching up on all the things I missed. I see Ishamael unconscious on the floor and a giant blizzard circling around what I can guess is the crystal bitch.

The lady that Ishamael was defending earlier asks Otis if we are running or fighting, to which Otis grunts, we are fighting! She whips out a wand and begins blasting the crystal thingy.

Otis drinks some sort of potion, then heals Ishamael, bringing him back from unconsciousness. The dragon person in this crew is just blasting away with some strange double beam attack, which seems to be effective.

The crystal bitch seems to have similar beam attacks but cold ones and targes Otis with them, seems that potion sorta protected himself against that. The crystal teleports forward toward us, and the blizzard around her follows.

The other dwarf seems lost like I was earlier, but looked like he has started to recover his vision.

I throw a Javalin into the ice storm, hoping to hit the crystal bitch to no success though. I hide in a nook to avoid those ice beams she was throwing out.

Otis charges into the gnarly blizzard, all I recall is hearing what sounded like a hammer smashing into some ice, so I think he found the crystal bitch.

The dragon dude again attempts two beamy things, but nothing happens.

Ishamael, who is still lying on the ground, grabs a scroll out of his backpack, and the next thing I know, a GIANT fireball leaps out of the paper and launches towards the crystal bitch. That seemed to do some work, cause the crystal began attacking with more ice beams, but missed everyone.

Finally, the other dwarf has had enough of her, attacks the crystal bitch four times, and on the last blow, he does a slicing diagonal blow that shatters the bitch.

We all hear her say, "You fools, you have no idea what you are doing!" Then she shatters into hundreds of small pieces and this time, she doesn't not recombine, we have finally slain the ice bitch.

Otis inquires if the ice bitch has any pockets to loot, is this guy mad or something? Pockets from shattered ice? He must be drunk! He begins collecting the ice shards into the same empty potion bottle he drank out of earlier.

The crew confirms they have no clue what happened with the stone dude turning on us and attacking me. We end up pushing him across the ice floor into a room where we can take a nice long nap in. Before we go to bed, Otis and Ishamael heal some of the many wounds I had received in the last fight, this should help me sleep better.

After we wake up, the lady from earlier says she needs our help to finish one of her goals, something about exploring an ice city that is now available to us now that she read that book from earlier. She goads Otis into agreeing by telling him there will be treasure there, he starts mumbling about more stew treasure, what ever that means.

Ishamael asks the lady how she felt with the giant ice lady behind her, she says it was wild. The crew then began going off about some 60 ft yeti and how the Ice bitch must have been 100 ft tall, the lady and I were just as confused, pretty sure it wasn't 100 ft tall.

The lady goes to eat some breakfast and we follow suit, I begin to ponder why I should go to this ice city and if I should try and escape. I don't remember these people and have very little reason to trust them after they almost got me killed. Then again, treasure is always nice, could always use a new axe!
