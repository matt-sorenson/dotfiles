# 58 - Avian Thunderdome

## ðŸ“… 18th of Uktar, 6:26am; inside Grimskalle

I killed a god. Nothing can stop me!

We head back out to the main room and give some more fish to Ukuma. He heads upstairs, and we follow. Since we're here, we decide to head up to the second floor to see if anything else of value is here.

The tall ceiling has several large icicles hanging from it, and a giant's throne sits on the south end of the room. Hirakas starts blasting the icicles so they don't come down on their own when we aren't expecting it, but to our surprise they start moving in a suspiciously hostile manner.

Hirakas casts a well-placed lightning bolt to strike and kill 3 of them at once. Hentacle arrives and attacks another one, but it has no visible effect. We each take turns throwing spells, javelins or crossbow bolts at the other large icicles. Ishamael knocks one of them down with a shove, and ThodÃ¼rr follows up with a finishing blow.

Once they are all killed, we head north to the other part of the floor.

Seeing some of the broken furniture, I deduce that this was probably home to Vasa Vickin, the last known frost giant queen. But that must've been at least 100 years ago.

We head up one more floor and discover a large bird's nest, about 30' wide. In the middle of the nest appear to be some silvery wooden objects and also something shiny. Hirakis and Otis are immediately interested and start digging. They find a 5' tall, 150lb silvery dragon egg.

On the west side, I notice 3 owls hanging around, who suddenly transform into humanoids and start aggressively gesturing toward us. They seem to speak in some made-up language. As I try to figure out their intentions, Hirakas sends out an Eldritch Blast toward the center one and hits it.

Two of the druids summon polar bears, one right between me and Otis, and the other next to Hirakas. Almost right away, the bear next to me disappears thanks to Otis' banishment spell. I move toward the closest one and hit it a few times with my sword.  Vellynne hits the bottom druid, and also breaks her concentration, causing the second polar bear to disappear.

One of the druids casts moonbeam on top of Otis.

ThodÃ¼rr comes out of his nipple-rubbing trance and throws a javelin toward the middle druid, hitting it directly. The shield guardian moves around the north side of the nest and continues dodging. The bottom druid casts an ice spell over Hirakas and ThodÃ¼rr, hitting Hirakas fully and ThodÃ¼rr partially. Hirakas reacts with Hellish Rebuke, dealing substantial damage.

The top druid also casts an ice storm, hitting me and the shield guardian. Although it feels colder than I expected, I suffer only mild damage.

Off in the distance, we see a giant bird quickly approach and land between the druids and the nest. It immediately attacks Hirakas with several powerful strikes and knocks him unconscious.

Ishamael casts Tasha's Mind Whip at all of the enemies, almost killing the middle druid.

The moon beam affects Otis, turning him grey. More than me. He moves out of the beam and casts Banish on the bird, succeeding in sending it to another plane.

I move out of the ice and attack the druid next to me, almost killing it. Vellynne tries to attack but misses.

Otis gets hit and his concentration is broken, bringing the bird back to our plane. But when the druid tries to get away, Otis hits and kills her.

ThodÃ¼rr rages, going after the bird and deals a lot of damage. The shield guardian moves into position above the bird and attacks it with its fist.

The bottom druid sends out another polar bear.

The bird responds to the shield guarding by attacking it, dealing quite a lot of damage.

Ishamael drags Hirakas out of the way and casts some healing on him, bringing him back from being unconscious.

Otis moves toward the bird and also deals some strong damage.

I attack the druid and eventually kill it by chopping off its head.

Vellynne uses Blight.

Hirakas stands up, spawns Henticle and casts two Eldritch Blasts at the bird.

ThodÃ¼rr uses a Great Weapon Master attack twice to hit it, again dealing a lot of damage.

The bird goes after ThodÃ¼rr but his impressive defenses help him withstand the attacks.

Ishamael casts Haste on Otis and myself.

Otis attacks with his Warhammer and then with the Spiritial Weapon and finally with an Inflict Wounds.

Feeling empowered, I attack 5 times in a row, dealing a lot of damage to the ass end of the bird.

Vellynne attacks with Blight, dealing a little more damage.

Hirakas finishes the fight by sending two more Eldritch Blasts right to the cloaca.

We use the geyser to put out the fire that was started on the nest.

Remaining loot:

- Art (carved heart of exotic wood w/ gemstones & ivory) worth 750gp
- Electrum chain with a bloodstone pendant worth 250gp
- Wooden sea chest covered with bird droppings and sealed with a heavy padlock, inside of which is:
  - 320gp,
  - Gold ring w/ black pearl shaped like a whirlpool worth 750gp,
  - Spell scroll of mass cure wounds
- 1000 lbs. of Rok (bird meat)

We put our logistics skills to use and push the giant bird over the ledge. We work on getting all the remaining crap over to our sleds.

We navigate back over to the starting area of the island and ring the bell for Angajuk. We go fishing for another knucklehead trout, but after only an hour the whale shows up. Ukuma is surprised to see another talking creature.

Travelling back takes 2 days.
