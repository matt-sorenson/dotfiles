The Man-Eating Moose had been brought low and was at our mercy.  Trussed up like so much overgrown poultry, Ishamael brought it back to consciousness as I prayed to Tempus to compel it to speak only truth.  The Moose flailed a little before we got it to settle down, but we pressed on and began to get the answers we seeked.  It had been made to speak with magic, not born with super-intelligence.

A human named Revicin was the culprit, but the Moose was avoiding as much detail as the zone of truth would allow it to.  We learned that he crunched not for pleasure, but to force the townfolk out of the forest and prevent their logging.  He crunched for injury, not death, simply because it took up the time and resources of other townsfolk who might otherwise enter the forest themselves.

After much discussion we realize a compromise might be possible between this mighty smart Moose and the people of Lonelywood, so once I had his assurance he would not crunch anybody we let him up.  We took to calling him Mr. White, which seemed befitting of the creature's cold dignity and intelligence.

As the others were taking a brief rest I went to check in on Thodurr and his poor chafed nipples.  As I approached I saw the most depraved thing â€“ Thodurr was spraying on branches before offering them to the Moose pack, which they gobbled up with what I can only interpret as delight.  One Moose in particular was particularly enthralled by Thodurr's crotch before being mounted by my hairy dwarven friend â€“ this was getting awkward.  Rather than risk an extremely uncomfortable conversation, I decided to trust that Thodurr knew what he was doing and left the scene without making myself known.

Before departing back to Lonelywood we decided to take a look at the immediate area.  We realized the central statue was actually a sort of moondial, casting a shadow in different areas depending on the moon's current phase.  Hirakas found a couple of doors with symbols on them â€“ symbols corresponding to those on the moondial.  He also spotted a mirror with another moon symbol â€“ a full circle, perhaps representing the full moon.  Judging by the current position of the moondial, it's shadow would fall on that symbol in the next day or two.  Ishamael and Hirakas said there's some sort magic in the area, but I got bored listening to them and took them at their word.

We eventually headed back into town with our Moose-friends in tow.  Hirakas, Greymond and myself head into town to get our sleds and discuss the situation with the speaker.  After getting yelled at for leaving my lantern on(this town sacrifices warmth...) we headed to the speaker's house â€“ it was late but we figured she'd want to know the situation.  She was amenable to the idea of compromising with Mr. White and agreed to a meeting the following day.  We took the sleds back to the others and camped for the night â€“ the stew was a big hit among the Moose, though that one Moose was still obsessed with Thodurr's crotch.  My dwarven friend might need a bath â€“ as a matter of fact I'm not sure I've seen him bathe at all since we first met.  Fortunately my nose has been broken enough times that I can barely breath through it at all, which is probably beneficial to our friendship.

After we ate Thodurr went in on his nipples again â€“ they were in a sad state, scaly, swollen and red so I prayed for Tempus to soothe his ailing areolas which seemed to help.  I noticed Hirakas toying around with some weird crystal he'd found â€“ it made my brain tickle when he focused on it.  He offered it to Greymond, who didn't seem quite sure what to do with it.

Once we woke up we headed straight towards town, leaving the Moose pack on the edge of the forest while we went to retrieve Nimsy for the negotiations.  The negotiations began, and through a masterpiece of contractual bargaining we come up with a set of robust zoning ordinances and regulations that satisfy both parties â€“ the north half of the forest would henceforth be "Moosetown", the exclusive jurisdiction of Mr. White and his less-intelligent brethren, while the southern half would be "Lonelyland" where the townsfolk would pursue sustainable logging practices.  After setting up a recurring meeting(every 3 moons!) at a neutral spot on the border of Moosetown and Lonelyland, we seal the deal with a contract signed in triplicate.  I fashioned a holder for Mr. White's copy and put it around his neck.

With the future of the town secured, it was time for Mr. White to depart.  Before he left we discussed the area we found him in â€“ apparently it was home to the Revicin person who had made him so smart.  He trusted us enough to be open with us, but was worried that our actions could make him stupid again.  We offered to bring him with us but he would have no part â€“ he didn't say as much but I think he trusted us to be careful, and would not stand in our way should we choose to explore the area.   I gave him a big hug before he walked away - I'll miss that Moose.

We headed back to town to finish with Nimsy, securing our payment â€“ 35g and the deed to a shitty ramshackle building we had no plans for.  We'll see if we can make wise use of it.  As nimsy was writing the deed we were approached by some sort of tiny man named Copper. He wanted us to check on his friend Magreedus, and upon finding him send him to Mantaur â€“ I believe I'd heard that name before referencing a deity, some sort of god of light, but I did not remember much specific about him.  The most alarming part of this was that this Magreedus was apparently hanging out in the cabin we'd sent the headache-crystal-crazy-man to along with the boy who kept fucking up his paperwork.  That did not bode well for them, but I guess we'll see.

Thodurr had also secured the loyalty of the four common Moose that had been accompanying us, so we put in a order for a custom moose sled and reigns.  They'd be done on the 2nd (reigns) and 4th (sled) of Uktar.
