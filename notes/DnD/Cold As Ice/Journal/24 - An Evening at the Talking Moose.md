# 24 - An Evening at the Talking Moose

## ðŸ“… 2nd of Uktar, 2:35pm

Arriving at Lonelywood we discuss what we want to do next, we come to the stable and get the reigns for the meese & ThodÃ¼rr pays some extra to get the wagon done for tomorrow.

ThodÃ¼rr puts the reigns on the meese, starting with professor crotch, it takes a bit be he gets there.

We head to the Ramshackle Inn to see our prize. We spend some time lighting the lanterns and checking it out. Otis tries to talk Shanar (the mummy) into being our inn-keep.

We start cleaning the inn in preperation of a grand opening while Ishamael goes to spread the word. He comes back with cookies from the Nimsy (the town speaker).

He goes from table to table putting notes on each, I assume a menu. As we're cleaning Nimsey comes in with more cookies and Ishamael introduces her to Shanar, she orders a bunch of stuff and sits at the bar. As we wait more people start to crowd the inn and we hold our first raffle for some of ThodÃ¼rr's mead.

I see copper come into the inn and he seems to have a problem and Otis takes him outside, a moment later Otis calls Ishamael out too. Once they come back in with copper otis and Thodur convince Red to dance on the table, which he does, prettier mediocrly. Ishamael joins him with a ferver which seems to offend Graymond, somethings really been up his as of late.

We hold another 2 rounds of raffles much to the crowds pleasure.

We may have hired copper to help work in our inn.
