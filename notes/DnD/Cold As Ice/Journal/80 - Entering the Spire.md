# 80 - Entering the Spire

I give Harakas some rare chalks and inks we've found along our journey as well as some amethysts so he could cast a new teleportation circle spell he knows, if needed.

We discuss the Arcance Rite and how we're going to be able to perform each step. Surprisingly little nipple rubbings. Are we sure this ritual is correct? We start heading to the spire's entrance anyways. Otis thinks we cannot stealth all the way to the spire. I propose having Thodurr lead ahead of us and I would message him checking in every now and then. Thodurr is a very stealthy dwarf and could take any kind of surprise or enemy that pops up.

Thodurr's scouting finds a creature ahead that's unknown to him. He says he'll try talking with nature to learn more. Otis suggests asking Tempest. Both learn nothing about the creature. Thodurr sneaks in closer to get a better look. After a few minutes, he comes back and tells us a bug man is lurking ahead. And not the bugs we fought at the spa area. It might be the murderous bug man trapped at the Tower of Conjuration.

Since we're pretty close to the ToC; figure we could dip in and check if the bug man is still there. The tower's first floor is overturned like someone was looking for something. Chairs and couches ripped apart and strewn around the room. Sounds of sweeping are heard around the room.

Otis readies himself and pushes through the magic teleporting door to the bug man's cell chamber. I ping Otis with message and he responses that the cell is empty. Someone, or something, set the bug man free. Otis takes a peak into the mansion part of the tower and even there is smashed up. Apparently the butler is still around.

We decide here's a good place to sit down and rest for a bit. Come up with a better plan now that we have to deal with the bug man too. We eat the food that's still at the table before. Thodurr said it was pretty good, and sure enough, it is. Graymond still seems a little untrusting, but with a little goading and waving a cockatrice in front of him he begrudgingly caves in.

Otis performs a new ritual of forbiddance that Tempest has told him that covers the area around the Spire's entrance. Faintly glowing runes that look like little Tempest swords fill boarder of the area. Outside the Tower of Conjuration we hear some people running and yelling about the ward that's been raised. Must be the "friends" Averace has brought with her.

We head outside and move towards the Spire's entrance. Barby devil creatures and the bug man from before are talking with two cultists near the edge of the forbiddance zone. Bug man starts talking about being told by Asmodeus that we've collected all the pieces to get into the Spire. I play that notion down and subtly cast Mass Suggestion over the cultists and the devils. Seems like suggestion has landed amongst half of them.

I ask if they're able to share with my all the knowledge that they know, you know, in a gesture of good faith if we're to be working together. We get some information that there's about 40 cultists in the city. That Averace brought some Gargoyles, some kind of elementals according to Prof. Mustache. Some other notes is that apparently all of Averace's little army really hates Lynn.

Bug man asks if we're able to take down the forbiddance zone. Otis and I convince them that Otis is able to take the ward down. Instead, Otis runs through another casting of forbiddance and we play that off as the spell being trapped causing another to appear. On top of this, I mime that we're not able to leave the zone. Bug man believes all of this, even though the cultists just walk out. They go and say they'll bring someone who could deal with the ward.

Hirakas performs the ritual after Lynn backs out. Each time he completes a part of the ritual a rune on the Spire's entrance glows revealing the symbol of the tower that the rite's ritual was associated with. During the ritual Hirakas revealed he ate people meat, those who died when his ship crashed. Required for survival, really. Otis reveals he's a doppelganger for the ritual too. We've seen it before, but honestly not the weirdest thing for us. Apparently everyone is revealing secrets because Jesus is a doppelganger too after seeing Otis show that he's one.

The Spire's shield falls with Hirakas successfully completing the ritual. A ominous cackle could be heard coming down from the top of the Spire. Most likely that head wizard lich Prof. Mustache told us about.

We step into the Spire's entrance and get levitated up to the central tower. The levitation ends and places us softly on the bottom of some stairs and a door at the top. Graymond leads the group ahead and hears a voice in his head to turn back. Not more mind magics. Apparently the message was from a magen that was here trying to prevent us from entering. Thodurr and Hirakas quickly take it out without any further trouble.

Opening the door at top revealed a sort of grand entrance or ballroom of sorts. Here noble looking individuals fill the room dancing and chatting like a party was going on. It seems they were able to converse with us, but Graymond was also able to poke through them. Seems like some kind of advanced illusion magic.

And then it could be heard again. The cackling which sounded like it was bouncing around the room trailing from the far end of the ballroom and ended loudest at the stairwell entrance behind us.
