# 40 - Goblins were asking for it

We discuss talking to the speaker about dzan/fzan, but with him disintegrated we collectively agreed there wasn't much point.  We decide to rest up for the evening before heading out to investigate Ishamael's persistent headache.  We talk to our old buddy Scramsax to secure a room for the evening, and make some stew. I use the newfangled chardalyn dagger I found and cast bless into it - I can feel the might of tempus inside the dagger and silently hope that it goes some distance towards combating the blight of the chardalyn.

We get up, feast on stew, feed the animals and prepare to leave.  Thodurr comments that we are running out of fishmeat for the dogs so we decide to swing by the town market to purchase some more.  Realizing it's 4:30 in the morning and that nothing is open the market we decide to just go ahead and hit the road.

We head down the Ten-Trail, stopping at the redrun to discuss Ishamael's headache.  He says he thinks we should press on down the redrun towards where his shield guardian is waiting, so onward we press.  We stop halfway and discuss - it feels like we're heading away from the source of the headache, but we decide to go ahead and find the shield guardian since we think it'll be useful for whatever comes ahead.

Once we arrive we see lights ahead - Greymond uses his keen eyes to scope it out.  He describes spikiness around the light, along with figures of some kind.  We huddle together as headsquid scouts the area, finding goblins and wolves together.  We painstakingly plan a course of attack for these mighty foes, ultimately deciding to scale a nearby cliff to get the height advantage on these wily goblins.  Headsquid flaps around again to scope out the area - we see a badass dude on a big woof.  We get above the tower and prepare our attack.  Before I move Ishamael infuses me with otherwordly haste - I have never been more prepared to smash some gobilns, and exact my vengeance for the near fatal blow I had been dealt by goblinkind weeks ago.

I burst inside a nearby building and start slaughtering goblins left and right, before bursting back outside and heading straight for what appeared to be the boss goblin.  I heard Thodurr knocking down a door inside and speaking to someone - no idea what that was about, but I was too caught up in the slaughter to care.  As I sped around killing goblin after goblin I heard my compatriots doing the same - eventually I noticed Thodurr dragging around a weird looking goblin.

I sprinted around the entire encampment, killing goblins and wolves while I watched my compatriots do the same.  Eventually we hacked our way through them all - sweet victory!
