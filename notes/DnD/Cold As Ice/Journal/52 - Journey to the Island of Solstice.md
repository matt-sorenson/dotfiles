# 52 - Journey to the Island of Solstice

We start today by apparently hating ourselves, we are returning to the sea of moving ice in order to help this Vellynne person. Hopefully the white dragon has forgotten our previous transgressions.

As we arrive, I begin rubbing my nipples to let the animals know we are leaving them at the coast. While nipple rubbing, Otis and Ishamael begin fishing.

After my nipple rubbing ritual completed, I talked to our animals and I even asked the seals to help protect our gear with the reward of fish if they do. They did agree.

Soon after my convo with the Seals, Hirakus shoots a seal with his weird blasty thing, killing it. All the other seals run away. I was not happy about this and let Hirakus know to knock it off, even mentioned why shoot the fucking seal if I'm literally talking in seal to them? Bark Bark Bark in Seal! Hirakus seems to understand my frustration but something is off about him. Ishamael asked him if he is ok, but Hirakus says nothing. I wonder if some of that evil in that gauntlet transferred to him. I will need to keep an eye on him, on the bright side, we are pretty good at restraining people when needed.

An hour passes and Ishamael catches an octopus. Before we call our whale transport, Ishamael and Otis talk to Vellynneon how to figure out where we need to go. Vellynne tells us she knows what to say to the whale. So we ring the bell to summon the whale, then we wait.

Ishamael and Otis continue to fish while we wait four hours for the whale to arrive. They catch a total of 3 octopus and 3 knucklehead trout's. While waiting, I angrily stew on Hirakus's senselessly seal killing and attempt to nap the time away.

After four hours, Anjaujuke the whale finally arrived, and she recognized our group from our previous visit. We mention that we need a favor to go get prof mustache, Vellynne clarifies, we need to get to the island of Solstice.

After hearing Vellynne, Anjaujuke lowered herself into the water and sighed a heavy sigh. She told us the island is very dangerous and shows some scratches on the side of her body. Told us there is a giant flying Roc that will attack anything that gets close. Tells us there are two routes either the long route, which avoids the roc, or the quicker route, which faces the roc.

We decide to take the long route to avoid the roc and the whale tells us to take the bell so we can call her when we need to leave the island of Solstice.

Before we leave, we didn't feel comfortable leaving the animals at the sea of ice for the six to seven days of travel we will need to make. We ended up asking Vellynne to have some of her Kobolds daisy chain all the sleds and wagons and return the animals to our tavern. We did take Otis's sled, as it has a lot of food and of course the magical pot, thankfully the shield Guardian will pull that.

Now that we have taken care of the animals, we hop on the whales back and start our two and a half day journey to the island. As we get closer to the island, we start to see the remnants of an ice giant civilization under the water, very mysterious.

At one point, the whale surfaced for us to see on the flying Roc. Greymond with his fancy goggles sees a better picture of the roc and sees rider on the Rocs back.

Finally we arrive at the island, but the whale must wait for the right time of day before dropping us off, once it was time, she dropped us off on a shore with a broken pier.

Before the whale leaves, she tells us to not ring the bell if the lights are on and only during the day. She also asked us to attach the bell to the dock so she can feel the vibrations further away.

I wave as the whale leaves and turn to look at the dock and see some 50 foot cliffs that we need to get over.

We use our climbing kits to climb up and use block and tackle to pull up Otis's sled.

We hear some sort of chattering coming from something, so Hirakus does his languages ritual, as we wait, we notice that this place is even colder then normal.

After Hirakus's ritual finishes, he talks to the thing. Hirakus tells us, that it is very cryptic, really just pointing out the castle, saying dangerous is afoot and points to an icicle that Hirakus swiftly knocks down with his blasty thingy.

Ishamael asked Vellynne if she expected this place to be habited, she tells us that she expects Oreal or as I like to call her, porcupine butt, is here.

Vellynne tells us we need to do two things here, first find some orb and something called a codicil, which should be in the castle. Mentions that once we steal the codicil, we will need to escape swiftly from the island. Greymond mentions that maybe we should find the Orb first, so thatâ€™s what we do.

We begin searching around the giant island seeing if Otis can detect this "Orb". Along the way we see multiple grand assemblies of ice sculptures of all sorts of creatures, from Yetis, bears, to dragons and other scary creatures. These couldn't have been made by human. Hirakus wanted to destroy some of the ice sculptures but Vellynne mentioned that we should remain as quiet as possible to avoid any alarms going off. Hirakus always wanting to destroy, again very worried about him.

We continue searching, along the way, we see a better picture of the castle, it looks like a giant skull, someone likes to be dramatic. Now isn't the time to go into the castle, so we pass it for now.  We do notices that the thing Hirakus talked to earlier is following us on our journey briefly saying nonsense along the way to Hirakus.

After randomly traveling around the Island, Otis finally detects this Orb thingy. We make our way to the location and find a dead humanoid corpse holding an orb. As we get closer, a weasel familiar comes and we hear a voice say, finally they are rescued, but it was the orb that talked.

We talk to the orb, typical Ishamael was constantly calling the orb Prof mustache, which the orb would correct him saying his name is Prof. Scant. Eventually the orb agreed that prof mustache would be an acceptable nickname. I don't blame him, arguing with Ishamael is a no win when it comes to names.

Vellynne ask the orb, are familiars supposed to go away if the owner is dead? Scant confirms, yes that is true. Otis does a check to see if the body is alive, but confirms it is dead. Ishamael asks me to chop off the head to be sure, while Prof Mustache objected, we explained that we have problems with the living ice dead, so just making sure they stay dead.

After chopping of the frozen bodies head, Otis searches the dead person pockets finding a bunch of spells. He takes the froZen head I chopped off, wraps it up and stores it.

Now that we found the Orb, all that remains is infiltrating the castle to get the second thing we need. Vellynne goes up and grabs the orb out of the frozen hand, the fingers crack and fall down. As that happens, a ghost come out of the body, looks at Vellynne and Otis with her head and yells, what the fuck. It's the ghost of the frozen corpse, Nass Lanatormir's.
