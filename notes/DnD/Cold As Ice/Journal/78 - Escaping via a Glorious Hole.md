# 78 - Escaping via a Glorious Hole

## ðŸ“… 27th of Uktar, 14:00; Tower of Illusion, bottom floor

We spend some time going over inventory.

We see a hole starting to appear and hear noise coming from the stone wall we created to block others from getting in.

We decide to try to stone shape a hole in the back wall and try to sneak out. Ishameal creates an illusion to make the door Otis created looks like a wall.

Thodurr tries to scout outside to see if there's a safe way out.

He sees some familiar faces, Ishamael has a conversation over message, so from our end it's very one sided

He fills us in:

- They're hearing the voice of levistus (a devil)
- They seem somewhat scared
- Otis should be able to remove whatever symbol they have on them


We decide to attack, doing our best to save the 2 we know, Jartha and garret

    Ishamael tells jartha the plan and we go.

    Ishamael hastes the dwarves

    Thodurr runs off and I hear the sounds of combat start

    Garret is definitely not happy to see us

        We had to knock him out as he was attacking thodurr and the iron golem saw him as a threat

    These guys are dangerous, They take a lot out of me.
    
    Otis removes the symbol from jartha, she suddenly feels cold and asks for some cloths, thodurr gives her his outer cloak (not the billowing one)

Otis then removes the symbol for garret and provides a cloak for him. We leave him unconscious for Jartha to deal with. Jartha carries Garret out.

We hide the bodies inside and ishamael re-creates the stone wall

We head to the tower of evocation
