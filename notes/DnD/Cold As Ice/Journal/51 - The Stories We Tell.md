# 51 - The Stories We Tell

The chardalyn shards of the dragon lay scattered across the street in Termalaine after its explosive end. Sadly, no pockets to be found and nothing else of note besides the seeping taint of chardalyn. Lynn and the soldiers give us aid in cleaning up the crystal rocks into sleds provided by Termalaine. I made sure that only we delt with this burden and did a quick once over after we were done to make sure we picked up all we could.

Hirakas still looked pretty beat up so I lent a bit of aid. Oris Mathews was excited to let us know that the Blue Clam survived and has brought us provisions from second breakfast. The speaker was intent on hearing about our victory. Otis recounted the tale of how the dragon was slain which leads into a tangent on reminiscing of Famed Local Hunter Milborn Taferact. May he continue living the good hunt in the next life.

Before leaving we ask Oris Mathews to see if they‚Äôre able to get word of casualties from Caren Koage, specially Jartha at Frozen Far Expeditions for Thodurr. No other requests noted.

We filled our bellies and the sleds, 10 in total. Made our way to Graymond‚Äôs home to seal up the evil shards.  Easy travels as we been there before. We arrive to a surprise at how much chardalyn we brought. Thanking us for our good work. Though I left the hall when Thodurr was trying to figure out the most inappropriate position to leave the dead grow dwarf king.

Otis and Thodurr placed some orders for custom +1 shields to be ready on the 23rd of Uktar.  One with Famed Local Hunter Milborn Taferact and the other of a polar bear / moose design. Both taking loaners for now. Graymond was happy with just the +1 shields they had and pick one up himself.

We head back to the Talking Moose to meet up with Lynn to get more information on what she wants us to do with Oreal. We retell the tale of the slayed dragon and destruction of other towns to Shanry and crew. We drink some mushroom ale which ends up being some of the most exotic and interesting flavors that I think Thodurr was taken aback. Though Graymond thinks he could do better.

As the day continued on Thodurr was sleep drinking while we placed an order for Copper to pick up something that could be smoked in our acquired hookah. The night drifted in with it a blizzard into the tail end of morning.

We finally sat down with Lynn and had a long talk about her and the Arcane ‚ÄúSister‚Äùhood. She‚Äôs looking for the Netherese and wants to find the city of Yithern which is estimated to be under a glacier east of here. She mentions some sort of codex that contains the passage underneath. We tell her of our expedition into the upside down Netherese tower and our meeting with Fadan and Zadan and their demises.

Really, she‚Äôs up here to find some others in the ‚ÄúSister‚Äùhood. Naas, Averas, and Zadan. Naas stole Professor ‚ÄúMustache‚Äù Scant, some orb or mustache, details quite unclear. Said Naas is out in the sea of moving ice. She thinks Naas is just trying to prove herself and may be getting into trouble and seek no ill will.

Averas is labeled as ‚Äúevil‚Äù and that she may need to be dealt with though no idea of her location. Stating she‚Äôs very white, no color in her skin, and a tiefling. Racial profiling if you ask me. I ask since all of the Arcane ‚ÄúSister‚Äùhood has colored pasts what is her worst offence. She responses that only her dabbling in necromancy. Take it as you will, I suppose.

We chat about plans to avoid the white dragon potentially seeking its treasure back, Angajuk and avoid a conversation about whale oil, and head out to the bell.
