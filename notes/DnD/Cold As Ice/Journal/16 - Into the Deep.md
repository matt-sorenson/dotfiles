# 16 - Into the Deep

We approach the Sea of Moving ice. Thodurr does his “song and dance” and talks/feeds some of the seals blocking the path out onto the ice where we will catch our ride out for whale oil. Helka mentions the seals could sometimes be aggressive, so better safe and leave it in the hands of Thodurr to smooth out these kinds of relations.

Helka is a bit hesitant on explain how we will be getting where we need to go. Says it is like we will be riding in a “magic seal boat”. Now - the way to summon this "seal boat" is using a bell, near a large hole of water, on the ice. I’m not sure the bell works the way she expected, as to me it seemed more of a dinner bell for three large vultures that Thodurr now kindly tells us is what the seal’s feared most. Thankfully, Otis - praise his god – heard their approach.

Our party quickly sniped one of the birds on its approach. The other two quickly falling soon after. Only Greymond took a couple of nips and scratches from the engagement that I helped heal up.

I spend our bit of downtime teaching Otis some ice fishing techniques. Otis was close catching something big, but sadly that got away. I too had some challenges getting even a nibble. We find out the trip ahead is going to be a good day of travel, so we decide to bring the dogs with us. Thodurr and Otis prep them for departure. I try my hand once more at fishing and reel in an octopus. I know I’ve seen one of these things before, but I don’t recall ever catching any at Bremen. Must have been a part of my time that’s been forgotten, before this blasted cold, dark, wastelands.

Quickly after catching this octopus and large sperm whale emerges from the fishing hole in the ice. This whale, named Angajuk, is quite kind and apparently served a person named Anga in the past. Carrying them around from place to place on a ship strapped to her back. The whale is a bit untrusting of us at first. Pretty happy to get ride of this octopus I offer it to her, freshly caught. She quite enjoyed the meal and welcomed us aboard.

We had a tight squeeze fitting on Angajuk’s boat, with all the dogs and all. Going down into the pitch black sea was not the most pleasant experiences either. It was novel seeing the bubble form around us as we lowered into the water, but without any light it was easiest for me to just sit under a blanket set up we had to reduce the chance of something out in the water seeing us from a distance. I was glad to have a least a bit of light. The dogs seemed glad to have that too.

Angajuk safely brings us where we need to go. I do a bit of bartering to lower the costs of the “fish oil”, since we’re make such a large bulk purchase. We then head straight back to land, though I’m not all to excited about making the journey back below in the dark. At least the headache has eased up a bit.

On our trip back, Angajuk gives us a heads up that she’s picked up a scent and that there’s most likely something on our trail. Thodurr starts prepping and ties everything and everyone down. I lay down a magical webbing as an extra layer of security. Not too long after everything and everyone is secured Graymond start tossing and shooting out of the bubble before Angajuk gets slammed.

Harakas brightens the lantern and reveals a shark right off the starboard side. Angajuk gets an all clear from us to do whatever she needs to do to protect herself. With the help of everyone, even Helka borrowing my crossbow, we make quick work of the shark. Angajuk takes a bit of a snack on the shark and Otis helps heal some of her wounds from the engagement.

The rest of the journey back across the sea was uneventful. We safely unload from Angajuk and load up our sleds for the ride back to civilization. Unfortunately for me the darn headache seems to have gotten worse again being back on land.
