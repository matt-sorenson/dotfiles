# 48 - Dragging a Corpse Around

## ðŸ“… 12th of Uktar, 7:22pm; inside Sunblight

After killing the devils, we think about our options and decide to check the remaining rooms in the facility. We loop around to the southwest and ThodÃ¼rr hears some lizard-like sounds coming from a set of doors. Otis steps forward, and his disguise seems to not antagonize them. The lizards have saddles and look like they're meant for getting around.

We leave them alone and head directly north, locating about 20 locked jail cells all packed together in a hallway. One of the cells is holding a human male. Ishamael hands him a ration and asks him some questions. He says his name is Dimplebottom and he was captured near Dougan's Hole several weeks ago.

We check the other inhabited cell, which has a creature who calls himself Talltree. The duergar ambushed him and took him here. We query his intentions but don't see any reason not to let him out.

ThodÃ¼rr locates the cell keys and unlocks both cells.

We move to the east and come across a hallway with several boxes mounted to the walls.

Otis steps forward and gets zapped by the circuit, taking a little damage. Creatures notice Otis (disguised) and question why he's there. I remember seeing a passageway above this hallway and climb up the wall to try and reach it, and position myself to assist if needed. Otis announces the regime change and tries to convince the group of duergar that they've been following a puppet. We ask about the heart in the forge, and it seems to be the source of how the chardalin was forged, but not linked to the dragon. We also asked about the gauntlet, and it was the key for forming the chardalin.

He says the dragon is designed for the cold, and isn't worth trying to freeze. Another speaks up and talks about the design of it. It has a powerful breath weapon and attacks from the sky first as much as it can. Then, it will land on the ground to continue attacking on foot. Finally, it leaves and heads to the next town.

We learn that Xardorok's chambers are on the second level, on the west side.

We tell the duergar to stay put while we keep exploring this floor. To the south are some more rooms. When we open one door, it looks like someone's quarters, decorated nicely. Ishamael takes a hide.

On the other side of the hallway, we hear voices from what appears to be an interrogation room. Otis opens the door and hurls Xardorok's corpse into the room. We tell them to stand down, but they do not.

Combat begins.

Hirakas tries to attack but misses. One of the duergar mind masters compels ThodÃ¼rr to attack Otis, causing some damage. ThodÃ¼rr snaps out of it and attacks the mind master.

Otis takes a turn, trying to attack with the warhammer. I move into position, missing the first swing but hitting with the second, almost killing one of the mind masters.

Hirakas casts two Eldritch Blasts at the second enemy, hurting it badly. It responds by attacking ThodÃ¼rr with a dagger, but it doesn't connect. ThodÃ¼rr then move into an advantageous position and deals some slashing damage with the greataxe.

I attack and again almost kill the enemy. Ishamael uses Chill Touch to finish it off.

Combat ends.

We talk to the chained-up duergar. She has been tortured quite badly and doesn't pose a threat to us.

Her role was apparently to help prepare to destroy ten-towns, but didn't really want to. Due to the insubordination, she was chained up and tortured.

The final door to the south contains a torture closet. Nothing of interest in here â€“ we have better interrogation methods.

We move to the treasure room and encounter two duergar hammerers. ThodÃ¼rr attacks one and deals a lot of damage. I attack the other and deal damage, but it retaliates (to my surprise) and hits me pretty good. The rest of the party comes in and takes care of them.

After unlocking a gate with Xardorok's gauntlet (pressed into a panel on the wall), we come across several treasure chests in an otherwise dead-end room. We match the number codes we found earlier to each chest and find the following:

- Nice alcohol
- Gold mask [worth 750gp] lying on a bed of 350 gp [distributed to party; 70 each]
- Silver spider chalice [with 250gp]
- Gray spider-silk robe, Wand of Web [ â†’ Ishamael ]
- Cloak of Elvenkind
- Amber headdress [worth 2,500 gp]
- 2ft tall stone statue of unknown creature:

Suddenly, Otis becomes frozen. Sensing something wrong, I walk up and try to get his attention. ThodÃ¼rr also walks up and becomes frozen as well. Sensing that the chest they opened might be doing something to them, I avoid eye contact with it and drag both of them back to the doorway.

The last chest has a skeleton covered in mold, and poisons Otis for some amount of damage.

- False eye [75gp]
- Running out of options, we decide to go back and try putting on Xardorok's gauntlet.
