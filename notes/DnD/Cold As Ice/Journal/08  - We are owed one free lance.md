# 08  - We are owed one free lance

## ðŸ“… 18th of Marpenoth, 5:30am (finished a long rest, group was fed)

We try to persuade Jartha to stay with our group, and succeed. We proceed toward
the west side of Kelvin's Cairn and to Thodurr's clan.

## ðŸ“… 18th of Marpenoth, 10am

We run into Kulmbo in the Dining Room, who advises us not to go through the long
hallway ahead. We turn left instead into another hallway and see tons of flowers
lining the hall.

Inside the room at the end of the hall is another dwarf who is doing something
peculiar with the flowers. The room is filled with kegs at various stages of
mead production, and cages with tiny flying creatures I have not seen before.
Thodurr and Ozzael Oakenhand seem to know each other well. He warns us of the
threat that the duergar (dark dwarves) pose, despite us killing them without
too much difficulty.

## ðŸ“… 18th of Marpenoth, 10:45am

I spot Otis consuming almost a dozen meads. He looks drunk. We collect some
finished kegs to bring back to the sleds. We depart for Caer-Konig.

## ðŸ“… 18th of Marpenoth, 7:45pm

We go to The Northern Light and return the stolen lantern. The staff were very
happy to get it back. Torvis seemed especially confused with our story as we
recounted it.

## ðŸ“… 18th of Marpenoth, 9:45pm

We also stop by Hook, Line & Sinker to return the stolen goats (Betsy & Davos).
The owner there is also thankful.

We head back to the inn for the night.

## ðŸ“… 19th of Marpenoth, 8:00am (finished a long rest, group was fed by the inn)

At Frozenfar Expeditions, we haggle for seemingly hours over the prices of gems,
kits, dogs, and goat legs to eventually exchange for 3 sled dogs: Mr. Bobinsky,
Luna, and Bear. Sled carry weight is 1500 lbs.

## ðŸ“… 19th of Marpenoth, 9am

We travel toward to Caer-Dineval.

## ðŸ“… 19th of Marpenoth, 1pm

We go to The Uphill Climb and deliver the new mead flavor to the barkeep.
He is pleased.

## ðŸ“… 20th of Marpenoth, 3:00pm

We travel to Easthaven.
