# 25 - Auril is a frigid bitch

## ðŸ“… 2nd of Uktar, Evening

We finished up our service for the evening and cleaned up after our guests â€“ poor Thodurr was scrubbing dishes by hand until Hirakas used his dark magic to make said dishe/s all spic and span.

Afterwards we decide to take another spin on the magic mirror.  Since I was still bound to it by the chest rubbing I had applied to it a couple nights before I was yet again in the driver's seat.  First we take a look at Nimsy and find her sitting upstairs feeding cookies to the moose crunching victim we had talked to before our moose/human peacekeeping efforts.

Ishamael asks if we can find his daughter with the mirror- the mirror responds but we end up finding a boy in some upscale digs, living it what seemed to be a warm climate far from icewind dale.  Ishamael is confused, as are we all â€“ I worry about the old man's mental state at times, but I know I am not always a paragon of stability so I am content to leave him to his delusions.

Next we take a look at Talia â€“ the little dingus that sometimes rides around on ishamael's shoulder.  She seemed happy hanging out in a nest with other chungers so we leave it at that.   After that we check on Erman, the draft dodger we'd saved from Aureal's snow zombies, and his roommate Havel.  They are hanging out in a bar drinking ale â€“ a good time indeed.

Finally we take another look at Trex and the Hungry Hungry Half Orc that mystified us the last time we used the mirror â€“ the situation had not changed, and the impression I got was that they were somehow sharing the same body.  I knew Trex was too smart for such a critter, Tempus only knows what kind of otherwordly nonsense is in play here.  We make a note to go and pay them a visit once we're able to spare the time.

After that's all said and done we retire for the evening.

## ðŸ“… 3rd of Uktar, Morning

That morning we talk to Copper and officially extend our offer of employment.  While exchanging tall tales with Greymond Copper mentions word of a Red Yeti terrorizing Bryn Shander â€“ says a local hunter named Mylbor Tafferac is looking for help in dealing with it.

Copper agrees to work for us, but is more focused on testing out the exploding device we'd secured from the bacon-like corpse of his friends in the cabin in the woods.  We start to test with a piece of fish as we had before but quickly realize the item is no longer explosive â€“ Copper says he thinks it's been drained of power.

He calls it the Summer Star and says it is intended to control the weather â€“ and that he thinks he can fix it.  After some time working with Greymond(with the rest of us helping fetch supplies) they add another ring to the device and declares that we're ready to test again.

No one else seems very excited to take ownership of the Summer Star so I volunteer â€“ I myself have no fear of it, this wouldn't be the first time I've been exploded and it certainly won't be the last.  After attuning to it I make an effort to control the weather â€“ the coal glows warm and it takes a while but it seems to work â€“ I warm up the local are and begin to sweat in my winter clothes.

Before long though I notice the weather shifting back, as if something's fighting me.  I make a concerted effort to fight back but instead it gets colder and colder.  I give up and break the spell just in time to notice something descending from the sky, a monstrous horned owl-headed avatar, one that appears to be Auril herself.

She immediately besets up on us, very unhappy about us poking a hole in her eternal winter.  Copper takes cover under the stew pot â€“ for the best, as I don't see him contributing much in our fight.  Auril is powerful, using intense frost magic that we are barely able to withstand, while teleporting and flying around making her incredibly difficult to strike.  However we have a trick up our collective sleeves â€“ Ishamael casts haste on Thodurr and he become a veritable whirlwind of axe blows, zipping to and fro across the battlefield at incredible speed.  Before long we've hurt the god enough to make her flee, but not before she summons a couple of coldlights to cover her escape.  Ishamael reaches into his bag of tricks and summons a SIXTY FOOT ELK â€“ such majesty I have never seen before.  We krump the coldlights easily with the help of this mighty creature â€“ I feel the pride of Tempus at the battle we just fought, and know that he recognizes and will reward the fervour in battle we have just shown.
