# 3 - The Best Number

Notetaker: Andrew

Session start: Continuing the murder investigation in Targos. About 11pm.

We check in with Erman, who was witness to the fight with the 'snow zombie'
Sephek Kaltro, but is still pretty drunk. He passes out.

Erman's roommate, Havel HorvÃ¡th, comes out. We talk for a bit. Agrees we can
stay the night.

ðŸ“… 14th of Marpenoth

Long rest until 7:10am. Erman sleeps another 2 hours.

Ishamael goes outside to retrieve the swords, but they are beginning to melt as
the magic wears off.

Otis also shows the smelly clothing as proof of the fight that occurred.

We convince Erman to travel with us for his own protection.

As we are heading toward the gate of the city, a large wolf-sized dog approaches
Otis and starts licking his face, apparently friendly but clearly distressed.
We decide to follow the dog to a house, where a person answers the door and
recognizes the dog. The person introduces himself as Keegan Velryn, and fears
his partner Garrett (a tour guide) has gone missing on Kelvin's Cairn, and asks
us to look for him. He gives the dog, Boy, into our care. (Quest: Find Garrett
the Guide)

We head to Bryn Shander and to the Town Hall to talk with Sheriff Southwell.
Once again, Otis airs out the smelly clothing for the Sheriff. Using a nearby
torch, we demonstrate that the swords are somehow magical because they don't
melt quickly over fire. It's clear these are the same kind of magical ice swords
used in the previous murders.

We hand custody of Erman over to Sheriff Southwell. Otis is given some paperwork
to hold him over: a wanted poster for a human wizard who may be disguised
(50GP reward for capture, 1GP for information).

Preparations are made to head out along The Eastway and then up north toward
Caer-Dineval. Thodurr buys a dog sled and Otis buys a questionable flail.
