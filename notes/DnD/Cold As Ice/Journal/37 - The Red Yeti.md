# 37 - The Red Yeti

We start today's journey in a very old tower call Kelvin's Cairn Lair on the 8th of Uktar at around 4:30 ish. Our party had just defeated a black ooze slim that hurt Greymond and damaged his gear.

The party started determining what we should tell Dezan since the last creature turned to black ooze, he has a chance to turn into black ooze also. We decided to leave the decision to him but give him all the details ahead of time. If he does turn into black ooze, we know we can kill it at least.

Otis examined me, I mean feeling me all over to determine if sacrificing my life force had any ill effects, turns out I am a very healthy dwarf.

Otis and Ishamael both went to talk to Dezan first but HIrakus wanted to do some testing before the rest of us headed up. He took a piece of wood and stuck it into the black ooze goo remaining on the floor. The wood was slowly eaten, not as fast as it was in the fight, but still working. Hirakus was curious if we could make an acid grenade with the acid.

The rest of us then catch up to Otis and Ishamael. Dezan forgot who we were, as he said would happen. Otis reminded him of our previous discussion and the results of the using the device that brings life to the non-living.

Dezan ask us if we should choose to stay in this room forever and forget every day?, Ishamael responds, "Would you remember staying in the room forever?"

Before we move forward, the party considers testing out the device more before using it on Dezan, but we decide that fighting one black ooze was already hard enough, if more of use take damage like Greymond, we maybe in bit of trouble.

Dezan wants to move forward with the test. Otis mentions his concern of having Krintaas come with us, that he may attack us if we have to kill Dezan if he turns into black Ooze. Dezan turns to Krintaas and tells it to kill him if he turns into black ooze. Well that handles that.

With Dezan and Krintaas in tow, we make our way back to the magical room that makes the non-living, living. Before moving forward, we strategize on how to instantly kill Dezan if he turns into black ooze and if I would be the life source sacrifice. We choose to be consistent, Dezan hopefully has a 50 percent chance of not being black Ooze.

Dezan moves into position, which requires standing on top of the goo from the first black ooze, interesting enough, the ooze did not eat through Dezan's boots.

I reach out to poke Dezan with one finger to give my life essence or what ever it is, It doesn't matter, I feel fine. A greenish glow happens and Dezan became real.

Quickly, Dezan asks us, tell me something he doesn’t know. I tell him that my mead is amazing and Otis says I have white pubes, I'm gonna murder Otis one day.

Dezan told us that the brain fog he has had for so long, has been lifted. He can finally remember things again. He felt tired since he has been awake for so long, but that didn't stop him from giving me a hug. Apparently Dezan liked the feel of my fur, maybe I should try hugging people when trying to sell my mead, just another reason to buy my mead!

Greymond is very glad we did not have to destroy him.

Dezan asked us to tell him what happened to the real him. We tell him that he got burned up by angry towns people for murder charges. Dezan asks what town, so he knows where to avoid. Ishamael tells him to avoid all the towns, as we have seen posters with his face almost everywhere. Later tells him that he was burned in Easthaven, so avoid that the most.

Dezan cast a spell and changes into a non-descript male villager, carrying a back pack. He says he can just disguise himself like this but he wants to remake his spell book. Otis lectures Dezan like a child to NOT START MURDING PEOPLE, Dezan agrees to this.

Ishamael ask Dezan about joining us to deliver information about the Arcane brotherhood to the town speaker in Brinshander. He was hesitant but Ishamael can be very convincing.

Out of the sky, I hear a massive rambling as a fluffy fellow makes sure his Dairy Queen blizzard is ordered correctly... Probably needed to have the perfect ratio of toppings to ice cream, served at a specific temperature, and delivered to him within a time window that is acceptable for his taste buds. I suspect this fluffy god in the sky has a lot of rules when it comes to food.

Out of the blue, Dezan remembers that my mead is good and to my dislike, that I have white pubic hair, I give Otis a death stare for that.

Otis then ask Dezan if we can get the amulet he promised us, which he agreeds, Otis gbrabs the amulet off of the desk. Next to the amulet were a few books that Otis snagged.

Ishamael shows the symbol from the prayer room upstairs to Dezan. Dezan knew that they were related to the goddess of all magic, Mistra. She is above all gods, and something about making this weave. Otis is not happy that another god could be above his god Tempest.

Ishamael and I ask what exactly is the weave. Dezan is surprised in our lack of knowledge, Ishamael tells him we are not book smart, and don’t know much about magic, but we do know a lot about paper work and tax codes. Otis ask what the tax codes were like back in the day in a joking manner. I tell Dezan that I still don't understand what the Weave is, he tells me that when I rub my nipples to talk to animals, the weave is going through my nipples... I have amazing nipples!

Before we head out, Otis informs Dezan that we are hunting a red yeti and he is welcome to join. Dezan says he needs to rest to get his magic back, but chooses to join us and will hide if we encounter the yeti.

Together, we all make our way out of the tower, climbing one floor at a time, taking the ropes we used to get down with us.

As I climb up , I hear some echoey sounds and grunts in another language that I don't know.
