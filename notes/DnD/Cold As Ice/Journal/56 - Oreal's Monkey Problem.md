# 56 - Oreal's Monkey Problem

Otis provokes Oreal into fighting him as he stands firm in his beliefs. I notice her in motion of casting a spell, most likely to freeze Otis like the others in the small chamber room he’s in and think quick as to how best to counter what she may produce. My thought ends on polymorphing Otis into the giant ape that Thodurr has been in the past. I only hope the monkey has a better chance at taking whatever smiting this could be. And, if we’re going to fight this deity here and now, I might as well go all out. I split the weaves and flow the magic into the next closest individual, Graymond. I wish I had time to let them prepare and consent to what’s about to happen and I can only hope they know what, and who, to fight.

Oreal summons an icy storm that envelopes the room in front of me in a furious blizzard like condition. Separating me from the rest of the party. The storm clears in a few short moments as ice and snow linger on the floor making it difficult to move around. Everyone seems to still be living, granted now two are giant monkeys. Oreal though has disappeared. I cast See Invisibility thinking that perhaps she’s like the grow dwarfs and hiding in plain sight. No luck.

Graymond-monkey charges out of the trial takers’ chambers seemingly a little confused as to where Oreal might have gone too. Seemingly out of thin air an ice blast hits Graymon-key in the face. He tries to swing wildly into the air with no luck. Same with my shield guardian even though I was pretty sure where the attack came from. I’m not clear as to the magic that’s hiding her from my sight. Perhaps some sort of divine ability?

Ape-Otis walks out of the chamber and seems to be distracted at the large wooly giant elk and gives it some pets. The elk seems to lean into the scratches liking the attention.

As this has been unfolding, Lynn has been quickly skimming through the stolen codex in search of what she needs to get into that lost, upside down, ice fortress of hers. And perhaps a way for truly ending this miserable endless night.

Thodurr on the other hand is shaken as to what’s been unfolding. Two “friends” apparently changing into giant apes and the instant fighting against some random creature. Though, Lynn pipes in saying we’re fighting a god. I walk over and give him a slap in the face. Grab his antlers and give him a stern look in his eyes. “We’re fighting what we came to fight. The others need your help. We need you to get mad at this bird like thing. You have a part in this fight too. Just focus this confusion and your anger at Oreal.” It seems this pep talk helps and all I can do is hope it does. Sorry I cannot give you the full explanation now friend.

Thodurr heads out with javelins in hand to Sir Walrus’s play area. Lynn keeps reciting the words from the codex as she copies them over onto a separate parchment. Grunts and roars of apes, sounds of rocks smashing, and blasts from Hirakas can be heard here in this chamber as the Shield Guardian and I stand guard waiting for Lynn to be ready. It feels like forever as the fighting continues and Lynn’s mumbles before she says she’s done. I have her double check just to be sure. We wait a moment more before she confirms and hands me the codex.

We walk back out and regroup with the party as we get enveloped in a flash blizzard all around us. As the snow calms down, I ask where Oreal is. Thodurr points and says she’s been teleporting around and points into the shadows beyond our light. I speak the words of Daylight into the Driftglobe and bright light emits from the small orb revealing the entirety of the room and revealing the god herself.

The monkeys, now having the target in sight, throw some large pieces of flooring at her while Hirakas follows up with some sniping blasts. Graymond chases her down as Oreal tries to escape back towards the trial door behind Lynn.

Oreal’s form changes after being struck down. Growing larger and larger. She becomes more humanoid in form and takes on a blue icy sheen. It seems this time she’s not wanting to run away.
