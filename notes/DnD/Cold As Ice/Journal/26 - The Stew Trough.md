# 26 - The Stew Trough


## üìÖ 3rd of Uktar, 2pm

Copper was safe after our battle with the spotlight walkers and Oreal. Seems the cauldron has more uses than just cooking food! Strange that Oreal, a god, retreat from battle over a bit of weather change. We check over the walkers‚Äô bodies to see if there‚Äôs anything we can glean. Our surprise when we find Keegan as one of them. It‚Äôs been just about a ten day since we saw him last over in Targos. Perhaps he was one of the unlucky few to get picked for the lottery?

Otis hums his prayer of healing over the party before leaving the little this small, wooded battlefield. Thodurr and Graymond help tie the bodies to the giant linen gray elk to help carry them back into town. Perhaps Nancy Nimsy, the town speaker, will be able to identify the other body. Warmth washes over us before our departure as Copper chimes out, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Morning Lord!‚Äù It seems our fight against one deity left us with some good favor in another. Perhaps we‚Äôll name one of the meads back at the in after this Lantern Lanathur.

The blizzard Oreal summoned during our battle still presses on as we make our way back to the Talking Moose. At least this provides cover in entering the town with these two bodies and the giant linen creature. We bring the bodies in through the back door of the inn and give the rundown to Shawnry about how we found them and who Keegan was. Otis takes some time to cozy up to the magic mirror and checks in on Garret who‚Äôs over at the Frozen Far Expeditions with boy. Seems from his expression on his face he already knows Keegan was selected for the lottery.

## Intermission #1

I head over to Nimsy‚Äôs place and inquire if she‚Äôs able to help identify the other body we found. She agrees and asks if we were responsible about the sunlight. I shrug it off and mention that less is more in these matters. Weather changes all the time. Though it seems she‚Äôs not quite content with that answer.

We head back to the Talking Moose. Nimsy looks at the body of the individual we don‚Äôt know; though like us is unable to identify them too. She‚Äôs in a bit of a shock, so we head back downstairs and eat some stew and drink some mead to get our minds off the bodies upstairs.

After a while, she inquires if we‚Äôre going to fix the weather and bring back the sun. We all attempt to sidestep the question again. Though Nimsy doesn‚Äôt like that answer and continues with what now feels more like an interrogation. Asking us why we became adventurers. Otis following his religion fighting for Tempus. Thodurr making mead and talking with animals. Hirakas just surviving after his ship crashed. Graymond exploring the world outside the world of forging ore. Myself, I‚Äôm just trying to look for my family. In the end, we assure her that the town is safe, and we will tell her anything we know if we think it will cause any harm to the people of Lonelywood. Regarding the sun, don‚Äôt expect that back any time soon.

## Intermission #2

We set out the rest of the day building the stew trough in great detail. All of us chipping in in various ways from design, labor, purchasing, and producing the stew.
