# 22 - The Beastly Adventures

We wake up at 10 in the morning of the 1st of Uktar at the abandoned cliffside cabin. I woke up noticing that my white hair has gotten a little bit longer and my canine teeth had grown a little, this bear totem is having some strange effects on my body. I then went out to do the morning chores of feeding the dogs and Mooses their daily breakfast. A whole cauldron of stew for the Mooses and a quarter of trout for the dogs.

As I was feeding the animals, I noticed Otis exiting the outhouse in a very uncomfortable manner, as if he couldn't get out all the poop out of himself, probably needs more fiber in his diet... Greymond also needed to empty his bowls in the outhouse, but he exited like he literally pooped gold, must have been the most amazing crap ever. I will say, he has been acting a bit more cocky as of late, something strange is afoot.

After packing up and emptying our bowls, we began our trek back to the elven magical runes we discovered in the woods while hunting down Mr. White, the talking white moose.

While riding towards the elven magical runes, Otis starts to look concerned and yells to let us know that a white creature is stalking us, not really completely sure as to what it is. Otis suggested we change paths and see if it follows, but the rest want to charge in and attack this new creature. Initially it is called out that the creature is a polar bear, hearing that, I immediately stopped my dog sled and began doing my animal talking ritual since I have always wanted a polar bear friend.

Otis halts just a little bit ahead and keeps an eye on the "polar bear", it then charges after Otis, which is when Otis notices that this is no polar bear but in fact an Snowy Owlbear. They notified me that this wasn't a polar bear so I readied myself for battle since I knew I couldn't talk to this creature.

Greymond whips out his crossbow in a heroic manner and shoots the create and hits it and then charges at the owlbear and hits it again with a sword this time. But Greymond is still not done, he then trips the creature, knocking it prone onto the ground.... Greymond is such a beast, need to remember to give him an extra mead for his beastly actions.

The rest of the party takes multiple swings an applies magical effects on the owlbear. Ishamael summons a badger from the back of tricks, but sadly it wasn't even able to make a dent. Otis smashed it twice with his Warhammer and Hirakus first hexed the creature then launched not one beam of his special magical blast, but now can shoot two at the same time, he hit it twice. What a cool fancy trick!

Finally it's my turn to attack, since I parked the sled a little further away, I had to make quite a run to the Owlbear, but as I approached, I launched myself into the air with my powerful legs and echoed a similar roar as the owlbear right before I cleanly sliced the owlbears head right off, as if it were ready to be put on the wall as a trophy.

Before we carried on, we needed to determine if the owlbear meat is something we can sell at any of the towns. We cut off a little bit of its meat and cooked it, once it was ready, it tasted just like a bear would taste, this will sell for a good amount of profit. So Otis and I proceed to gut the dead owlbear and stored 440 lbs of its meat on Otis's sled.

Since the sleds were overloaded by the Owlbear meat, we were about to start walking until Ishamael convinced me to try and talk to the Mooses to see if they would let us ride them. I did my completely normal nipple rubbing ritual and sweet talked the Mooses into letting us ride them while feeding them some stew.

Before we left, Otis decided to name the moose that likes my crotch as Professor Crotch, I ended up riding him, while Greymond rode another one of the Mooses. Look at this epic dwarf duo, riding Mooses like a boss.

Otis begins navigating us through the woods towards our original target of the elven magical runes.

INTERMISSION

At this point Curtis breaks character and loses his shit about how SHITTY apple computers are!!! Something about how he can't stand that his discreet graphics card is being used for his second monitor. Then the DM proceeds to join in on the technology hating.

END INTERMISSION

We finally arrive back at the elven magical runes at 8 pm. The rest of the party scouts ahead while I stay back to treat the Mooses to a little bit of stew for carrying our fat dwarf asses. I quickly catch up to the party and see Ishameal attempting to use his magical hand to touch the mirror but nothing happens. Otis also attempts to get a reaction from this mirror by poking the eyes out in his reflection. He seemed to feel something special in his two fingers that he poked the mirror with, Ishamael proceeds to apply his whole hand to the mirror and seems to experience a similar feeling as Otis. Otis, who I guess was drunk again or something, proceeds to take off he all clothes from the waist up, in this freezing weather. I am just amazed by Otis sometimes, its not like has a bunch of hair to keep him warm like me.

Otis then proceeds to apply his whole belly and chest to the mirror, then turns around while leaning his whole back against the mirror in order to maximize contact with the mirror. He is very determined to find out what this mirror is for. Otis applied his naked back to the mirror in the freezing cold for an entire hour. After that hour, he had discovered that he could use the mirror to look at anyone in the entire world.

Otis decided to test this out by looking for Mr. White, the mirror changes to a vision of the awakened white moose. It looked like he was surveying the newly designated protected forest. He calls over the whole crew stating that the mirror is a scrying mirror.

Otis proceeds to look up multiple people that we had previously met based on suggestions from the party.

First he tried looking up Nars, the one we sent to the abandoned cliffside cabin with the clerk. Nothing showed up for Nars though. He then tried to scry the clerk next, but again nothing shows.

He then tries to look for Trex, the shifty Kobold that we had met before, and this time the mirror shows us the familiar looking half orc Orkus, the town speaker, in a room reading about plants. Ishamael wondered if the Orc and Trex were sleeping together or something, but we were not really sure. Really curious why we were shown Orkus instead of Trex. Otis proceeded to look for Orkus and again we were shown Orkus in the same room but the mirror was a little darkened and kinda blurry, something strange is afoot, we should probably check in on Orkus!

Otis began trying to look up a few more people, but nothing would show on the mirror. He attempted to view Dezzan, the wizard that we witnessed being burned alive. The mirror shows us a dark room that was blurry and kinda muffled and then we see these two characters:

Somehow the wizard was alive, none of this makes any sense, and who is the other person with Dezzan? I wonder if we will ever find out!

Finally, Otis looked up his last victim, Ravinson, the one entombed at this location. The mirror shows her in a circular room with smooth stone work and we see a half moon door, which means she has to be behind one of the moon doors right now.

After determining which door she was behind, Ishamael proceeds to use his mind talking ability to communicate with Ravinson. During his mind talking, he looked rather annoyed with who he was talking with but then ended the conversation suddenly and filled us in as to what had been discussed. It turns out Ravinson was the one that had awakened Mr. White. Ishamael filled her in about our dealings with Mr. White and Ravinson accused us of ruining Mr. White. She claimed that she owns Mr. White. Otis was enraged with how she thinks of Mr. White. I have a feeling this won't end well for Ravinson.

Ishamael again attempts to contact Ravinson to ask if she needs any help, but says the wrong name, she was not fond of the incorrect name usage. Again Ishamael attempts to ask if she needs help, but responds that she doesn't want help from our filthy hands. At this moment, a bright cylinder of light appears right before the door to the chamber that Ravinson was in.

Ravinson cast a blinding light beam on the door and the door opens up. Ishamael tried warning me not to run into this room, but I ain't worried about some fancy light tricks. As I rush through the threshold, the many hairs that grow on my body got lightly singed by the light... I probably should have listened to Ishamael. Next to Ravinson, was a plant like creature, and she ordered it to Swarm and attack. The plant creature runs to the back of the room and we hear a few loud thuds in the distance behind us. I guess more creatures are approaching us from the south.

Ishamael, Greymond, and I decided to continue facing Ravinson, while Otis and Hirakus proceeded to face the new enemies that had been unleashed upon us. The three of us attempt to overwhelm Ravinson as quick as possible so we could aid Otis and Hirakus. We all enter the room with Ravinson, Ishamael attempts to hasten me but Ravinson launches a massive hail strike upon the three of us, which badly hurts Ishamael and cancels the effect that seemed to hasten me. I was angered by the previous icy attack so I attacked Ravinson with two mighty blows of my Axe. Ravinson ordered the plant creature in the room to attack me, but only managed to tickle me. In the distance, I could hear Otis taunting the new enemy to the south by saying "I fertilized your mother, I might be your daddy" which means he is probably having a wonderful time over there.

After retreating and healing a bit, Ishamael hastens Greymond and tells him to go get her. While moving with extreme swiftness, Greymond charges through the beam of light at the door and towards Ravinson and launches a series of attacks against Ravinson, He swung his sword 6 times and hit her 5 of those swings dealing a major blow against Ravinson, she was looking like she was hardly alive. Jesus, Greymond!!! What a BEAST!!! I really really owe him a cup of mead. Ravinson, who was not looking well, attempted to make a wind wall but it hardly affected Greymond and I. She tried running away from us, but that allowed both Greymond and I to attack. Greymond sliced horizontally through her entire chest with a mighty blow while I swung my axe at her legs, chopping one off and getting my axe half way through her other leg. Ravinson, didn't have a chance! I turned to the remaining plant like creature in the room and turned it into compost with one mighty blow. It was now time to see if Otis and Hirakus needed any help.

Greymond, Ishamael, and I moved towards the remaining enemies to the south, but Greymond, still hastened, zoomed right past us. As I started getting near Otis, I could see a large circle of swirling spirits and am warned by Otis to not enter it since I am not protected from it. I witnessed two more plant like creatures attempting to traverse the magical circular aura that Otis had made, only to see them get destroyed by the swirling spirits. I most definitely will listen to Otis's warning.

Otis orders his magical spiritual weapons to attack what looked like a giant living tree. Greymond reaches the tree creature and swings his sword at it twice. Ishamael strikes the enemy with a mind sliver. One of the last two remaining Tree creatures were killed by the swirling spirts, this magic from Otis is insane. Hirakus finally ends this fight by launching a massive double beam attack, killing the  tree instantly.

We are some beastly mother fuckers!
