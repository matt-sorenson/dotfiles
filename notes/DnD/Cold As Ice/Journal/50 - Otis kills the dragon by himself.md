# 50 - Otis kills the dragon by himself

We steel ourselves as the dragon approaches, Hirakas staring strangely at Thodurr tweaking his leathery, sandworn nipples so that he can command the animals if needed.

We move our sleds out of the town, positioning ourselves to have a clear ballista shot at the dragon.  Velma yells some bullshit at us about staying apart, but I don't listen to her and continue doing as I please.

We make our first volley against the dragon as soon as he is within distance.  The ballista and my laser rifle miss, but hirakas manages to wang him with one of his eldritch blasts.  The dragon unleashes it's breath at my wagon, sizzling me good.  I cure myself but find the result lacking - I don't think tempus approves of this cowardly ranged combat.  The dragon largely ignores us and goes about making strafing runs at the town.

The dragon flies up higher and resumes its course towards the town, as we debate how to stop him.  Hirakas and Greymond continue their ranged assault - it doesn't look like it's doing much, but it IS doing something.  As our pursuit rages I hear a faint 'you go girl' come in from across the battlefield, and feel strangely reassured and slightly less sizzled.

I move towards the dragon and heal myself again, before realizing Hirakas has somehow taken flight and is slowly floating towards the dragon.  We continue chasing the thing - it seems to be changing trajectory.  All of a sudden I see hirakas teleport directly above the dragon and land right on its back - I don't know what he has planned but I am intrigued.

It's not long before I see the dragon whip its own back with its tail, and notice hirakas floating in my direction - maybe he managed something with the gauntlet?  As we move forward a little more I see the dragon make a swipe at hirakas - he starts hurtling towards the ground and lands in a big cloud of snow.  He's probably fine.

Regardless, I press forward to where Hirakas had fallen - he was unconscious but didn't seem to be in THAT bad a shape.  I tossed him a heal so he'd wake up, then we reconvened to plan our next course of action.  The dragon is still attacking the town, ascending and descending to toast building with his gnarly dragon breath. Yet again we ventured forth to try and head him off.

We manage to catch up with it mid-pass in the middle of town, and strike it with a couple more glancing ballista shots.  It descends closer to the ground than it was before - I think the fight is on.

As I see it get close to the ground, I hop off my sled, putting a corner between myself and the dragon - I command it to "land" and tempus be praised it works.  I think my god appreciates us finally making this into a hand-to-hand fight.  I rush forward, summoning my sacred sword and throwing holy flame while I see the others attacking from down the alley - a glorious pincer attack!

As the assault continues, the dragon moves forward and attacks me - I take a glancing blow but shake it off and direct my holy sword directly up its cloaca.

The dragon explodes in a burst of chardalyn, and I barely manage to avoid a spray of crystals that whiz by my head.  We are victorious!  As we settle down I take a moment to remove the curse on hiraka's gauntlet, so we can be free of that useless thing.
