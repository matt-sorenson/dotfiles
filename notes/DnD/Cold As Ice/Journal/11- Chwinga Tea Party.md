# 11- Chwinga Tea Party

## üìÖ 20th of Marpenoth, 9:30pm

We debate heavily over the logistics on bringing back the lost fisher‚Äôs boat. Should we do it? Will there be a reward? Money? Fame? Eh, these old bones just tire of the cold and could not care less what we do ‚Äì long as I am not dragging anything heavy back. They decide to stack the boats and we set off back to Easthaven.

I suppose that mysteriously delicious cauldron attached to Otis‚Äôs hip might be the most valuable thing we found yet. Water into stew is quite a remarkable magic!

Upon our approach into Easthaven the Chwinga lantern finally starts changing into a soft green. I ask Greymond to recall his encounter to re-enact a similar scenario to hopefully lure one of these mystical creatures to me to learn more about them. Sadly nothing happens after 10 minutes sitting alone on the ice. I decide it is just best to cut our losses and just head into the city.

By the gods it seems the Chwingas are in the city! Or, at least, the outskirts here near the docks. I would not expect the Chwingas so close to civilization like this. We reignite the hunt for the creatures. After a bit of aimless wondering, we seem to found the direction where the lantern continues to grow more vividly green towards a quaint house from the looks.

An old lady can be heard yelling at something from inside. Peaking in through a window the old lady seems to just be mumbling to herself now cleaning up some broken plates on the ground. Before we really plan how to interact with the Chwingas the old woman opens the door to throw out the broken dishes and inquires who we are. Without missing a beat Otis chimes in that we are here about the lost souls that are visiting her home and with him being a man on the cloth he will expel them from the house. The old woman is a bit skeptical, especially since we ask her to leave home for a bit while we deal with the situation. I give her a couple of gold and tell her we will come when finished. It seems the ‚Äúghosts‚Äù are taking her cutlery.

We quickly begin our scouting for ‚Äúghosts‚Äù. Searching through the rooms. Only finding broken dishes and cutlery laying on the floor. A window in the kitchen was left open. Perhaps they have went out that way. I tell Otis to quickly scout around back and hope his god guides him into finding some sort of trail. Fortune seems to favor us, and Otis points out some small bird like tracks walking through the snow off away from the house. Thinking a larger group would scare these things away Otis guides just me along. The rest of the group was tasked with cleaning up the mess the ghosts left behind. Before leaving I snag some more of the old lady‚Äôs cutlery and follow Otis.

We make our way through some trees and approach what looks like a small pinecone / tea party the little creatures are having. One seems to be attempting to carve up the pinecone while another shovels the make-believe food into its mouth. Our initial entrance seems a bit to startle them a bit, but I offer the cutlery I brought to them and they seem to cheer up and hand me a fake drink. They don‚Äôt really seem interested in Otis. Though he did offer some of the random hag fingers to them. Perhaps tea parties isn‚Äôt for him. They remind me of my girls, wherever they be.

After some time I learn that their faces are like their names. Each unique. I spend some time drawing them and getting them to print their hands on some paper for that scholarly lady ‚Äì whatever her name was.

We head back to the Wet Trout and we tell the old woman that Oh-reel(sp?) desires cutlery and plate sacrifices now. She is not happy about this. Scython (sp?) asks about more info and we ask about info back first. Nothing is gain, but he knows we will need to chat with the captain first.

We spend the night at the inn where Hirakas summoned his squid owl. Otis lugs up his stew up the stairs, getting some a bit over the place. We get into a small debate with the owner about ‚Äúfree stew.‚Äù We plan for a s√©ance in the afternoon and selling a portion of Thodurr‚Äôs mead.

Hirakas pick up some more charcoal thingies for his owl squid. Otis praises the dwarf‚Äôs metal.

Otis seems to really love his stew as he keeps dragging it around. Pretty sure I saw some heads turning as we walk down the street.

We talk with the captain at the town hall and explain the situation with the cauldron we procured. The captain is very fixated on the pot. We eventually sweet talk our way into getting both the items from searching for the fisherfolk.

We spend an absorbent amount of time that there's no people in this stew. Both with the inn keeper and the captain at the town hall.

The town‚Äôs speaker, Danneth Waylen, is very interested in buying this stew. Offering a thousand gold to help feed their town.
