# 75 - Pockets of Ice

We take a short rest in the tower of Enchantment and divvy up some magic items - I get my hands on a fancy staff like the one Ishamel has, then head off to continue our search for the fancy rite thing we been learning about.

We decide to pass the tower of illusion and head straight for transmutation in an attempt to cut off the invading forces.  We see 3 people hanging out in front of the Tower of Transmutation - they're wearing chardlyn embedded robes with a black upside down sword emblem on them.  Ishamel deduces that these are the same cultistmajigs that attacked Graymond's home - the ones that were encased in ice by the time we found them.

We head towards the tower and approach the individuals - they try to warn us off, but we approach closer.  Ishamel opens up a conversation, asking them 'what are you here for?'.  They are not receptive to our attempts at conversation, so I command the one Ishamel spoke to to 'answer!' - he says they are here to 'free our lord and saviour'.  The other cultists engage us with spells, throwing an ice storm in our path and hurling a firebolt at Thodurr - which bounces off an invisible wall of force he's conjured with his newly attuned Cube.

I close the distance and summon my spiritual weapon before commanding one cultist to sleep and commanding the other to get bashed in the face with my hammer.  Graymond, Mr. Golem and Mssr. Shield Guardian close the distance as Ishamel, Hirakas and Vellen blast them from a distance.  For his part Xerephon cowers uselessly in a most unattractive display.

One of the cultists yells up at an open hole 20 feet up in the tower, calling for help to an unseen ally within, while the other cultist attempts to blast us with a cone of cold, which again dissipates harmlessly against Thodurr's cube shield revealing a perfectly cubular frosted outline of the otherwise invisible shield.  Me and Graymond de-testiclize the sleepy cultist to death and Ishamel's shield guardian barges through us to bloody up the cultist nearest the tower.

A more heavily armored Cultist emerges from the tower, drops out of the hole on the side, calls us heathens, and proceeds to slash at me fruitlessly with his scimitar.  Ishamel and Vellyne blast the other nearby cultist before Thodurr closes in for the kill.  Both of the dead cultists turn to ice as they die, just as we had seen in the tunnels of Graymond's home.

Graymond and the robots rush down the third cultist who was trying to escape and beat him to within an inch of his life while Ishamel strokes him to death with his ghostly chill touch hand.

The last cultist was standing inside Thodurr's spell shield, so I resort to hammering him while Ishamel and Hirakas run inside the shield to blast him at point blank range, turning him into an icicle.

We smash up the corpses looking for pocket goodies but find nothing except for some crappy chardalyn daggers and some symbols of levistis.

We approach the tower and notice a conspicuous lack of doors.  We desire to have the golem bring us up through the hole in the tower, but aren't sure how to communicate it. We have Ishamel demonstrate with the shield guardian, which seems to get through to the golem.  Graymond is lifted up abruptly and enters the hole in the tower - yelling down to us that there's a small room up here.

We enter the room and see a couple mannequin bodies on the ground.  Nothing in their pockets, but we find some mandrake root in boxes in the room along with an expensive looking jeweled dagger.  We move to the next room and find a skeletal corpse with a small brass key on it. Continuing on with see a statue of an elf in front of some kind of device.  It's got two keyholes and a small slot on the side labeled 'quicksilver'.  It's got a lever with three positions - 'deimos', 'galvan', 'hypnos.'  Further down the hall are some smashed up glass vials leaking a dried up silvery liquid.  There is a door central to the hallway we're in that I open to reveal the ground floor of the tower, with a slightly raised stone slab with a weird symbol in the middle.

I tie my rope off and climb down into the main chamber of the tower.  There's an inscription of wizards lifting rocks in the air with magic. Every 20 feet up doors lie flush like the one we just crawled out of.
