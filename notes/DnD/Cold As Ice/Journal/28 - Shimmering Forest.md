# 28 - Shimmering Forest

## ðŸ“… 4th of Uktar, 8:14pm; Town Hall in Termalaine

We're presented with a special flask [Decanter of Endless Water] that produces an apparently endless supply of water. Certain words will produce different amounts of water. Seems almost as useful as our stew pot.

We stop by a weapons shop to buy and sell a few things, then head back to The Talking Moose in Lonelywood.

Albert is a side piece.

We talk with Copper and learn that the Summer Star is inert at this time. It may be possible recharge it though.â€¯ThodÃ¼rr talks with Sahnar to set up a mead courier between the mountain and the inn so we don't have to do everything ourselves. The cost is 25gp.

Long rest

## ðŸ“… 5th of Uktar, 6:30am; The Talking Moose

We prepare to head north in our new "flying V" formation.

Front: Moose Wagon: ThodÃ¼rr, Hirakas
Left: Dog Sled 1: Otis, Ishamael
Right Dog Sled 2: Graymond

After travelling for a few hours, someone hears what sounds like clanging off in the distance. Ishamael messages the group to keep an eye (or ear) out. As we get closer to a wooded area, some of the trees appear to be... glistening? Not something I've seen before. We stop and take a closer look but can't determine the exact source. Almost like a trick of the eye. The noise is a little louder the closer we get.

We tie up the animals at the edge of the wooded area and proceed on foot. There are black crystal-like shapes coming from the ground. Thanks to Headsquid's scouting, we locate 4 Duergar, one of which is in a metal suit. That one appears to be mining the crystals and causing the sound.

## ðŸ“… 5th of Uktar, 11:15am

Because of our lanterns, they spot us and seem eager for a fight.

Start Encounter

We advance slowly to the north, trying to get a good position on them. ThodÃ¼rr takes a running leap toward the nearest large tree, but misjudges the jump and lands flat on the ground. I run up further to take point and try taking a crossbow shot, which misses. I blame the wind.

Ishamael uses his bag of tricks to summon the giant elk again, which charges at one of the Duergar but barely misses and hits the crystal next to it instead. The enemy tries to retaliate but is so shaken it completely misses the elk twice. ThodÃ¼rr, not giving up on the tree, decides to climb it instead.

More Duergar appear out of the woods, screaming and moving toward us. One appears right behind Otis and enlarges itself. Ishamael casts a spell on ThodÃ¼rr to make him lighter on his feet, and he leaps out of the tree toward the embiggened baddie and rages for some strong damage.

Another enlarged Duergar appears right behind ThodÃ¼rr to flank.

I work on attacking the creatures coming from the west, but my ferocious attacks don't seem to connect. Maybe I was cursed without knowing it.

One by one the group takes down the remaining enemies and are eventually victorious.

End Encounter

Next session:

Need to conduct area investigation and waterboard interrogate the captured Duergar.

Need to measure the giant elk for harness purposes.
