# 73 - Spider Clothes

## ðŸ“… 26th of Uktar, 7:44pm; Tower of Necromancy

DM kills Vellynne; Jesus is hacking.

Vellynne, Hirakas and ThodÃ¼rr leave to make their way to the Tower of Divination. The translation orb is left with the rest of us.

Lavistus lords over the icy hell.

Tower of Divination:

The High Diviner isn't here. Vellynne spends a minute looking through the telescope, and counts about 50 enemies. Many of them have chardalin armor, mostly humans with some dwarves and teiflings among them.

ThodÃ¼rr picks up the entire telescope by himself like a champion and brings it out of the tower. They regroup back with us in the other tower.

Tower of Necromancy:

The spell being cast by Ishamael finishes, and his old body is now reanimated. After some soul-swapping musical chairs, the necromancer returns to his own body, and Ishamael is back to himself. Ishamael uses Comprehend Languages on the necromancer to make communication easier.

We move downstairs so he can reconnect with his apprentice. The brain-jar seems incredibly happy. Ishamael's statue takes hold of the telescope, since we need more things to add to our collection. Cadavix uses the telescope to look for his lost partner. Cadavix suddenly loses his right eye to the telescope, but seems less disturbed by this than one would expect. Vellynne provides him with a spare eye patch.

Our group moves on to the east and arrives at the menagerie. In the middle is some kind of wheel and lever system. Cadavix says it's able to make a creature. In order to make it work, we have to fill 8 containers (80hp) with blood. Otis' abracadabris is able to produce the required blood, and the machine produces a weasel with glowing eyes. The group goes a little crazy and starts producing another weasel and a color-changing fox.

A large, blue, semitransparent hand is walking toward us. Before long, 3 more appear and surround us. We start an encounter. The stuff the hands are made of isâ€¦ weird. We can hit them, but it's not like a normal creature. The Iron Golem follows me into battle and lands a solid hit against the hand I'm facing.

Otis manages to remove one from the battlefield entirely with Dispel Magic. That feels like cheating.

The Shield Guardian attacks with its fist and deals some damage. The hand turns to me and grabs me. Another hand grabs ThodÃ¼rr, but he slices it in half from within. He runs over to the hand holding me hostage and also kills it as well.

Ishamael casts Chill Touch (hand touches hand). I run over to the last hand and proceed to attack. The Iron Golem finishes it off with a high-five from the sky.

Encounter ends.

We don't notice any spellcasters in the area who could have created the magic hands. Cadavix inspects the sample of chardalin that Otis had, but doesn't seem to know much about it.

We move on to the theater and notice a broken ceiling at the top of the dome. Everything inside is covered in frost, and there's not much of interest. In the back of the stage is a writing desk covered in chains and a padlock. Otis smashes the lock and in one of the drawers he finds 5 papers with writing (can't read). Xeraphon comes over and identifies them as scripts for plays.

- A Blasphemy of Kings
- The Martyr
- The Traitor
- Bewitched
- Haunted
- Fool

Next on the tour is the Hall of Silk, which is apparently a clothing shop. Guards stand outside the entrance, and silk robes are displayed. I step inside and notice even more shiny things around.

From the ceiling, a spider descends on me and starts wrapping material around me. However, it's not attacking me, and after standing still for a minute watching it, the spider appears to be producing a piece of clothing. After 10 minutes total, the result is a red robe, and a quite fine one at that.

An illusion who identifies himself as a Silksmith announces (via translation) the services offered at the store. The rest of the party requests robes and pants of various colors and designs.

After leaving the shop, I notice lights coming from the direction of Tower of Conjuration.
