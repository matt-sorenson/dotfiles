# 72 - Iron Golems, Talking Brain Jars, and the arrival of Averice

## ðŸ“… 26th of Uktar, 1492 15:17:44

We just finished slaying a five headed dragon, I will say, it didn't seem tough at all, pretty sure we could take on that white dragon from our previous travels. Would love to punch in some more dragon testicles.

Our crew leaves the well and make our way over to the Bazaar of the Bizarre. As we approach we start hearing loud thumps and crashes of some kind. We move in to get a better look to find a giant iron body that is missing a head, in fact the patterns on the body look very similar to the Iron golem head we found earlier, the head that agreed to join us when we head back out of the cave.

After a quick discussion we decide to head back all the way to caves to retrieve the golems head and bring it back here. After navigating through the whole cave and searching for the golem head, we arrive at the golem head and pull out professor mustache to translate for us. After confirming that one blink means no and two means yes, Otis gets confirmation that the golem head can make his body not smash up things any more.

Greymond solo carries the whole golem head back to the Bazaar of the Bizarre, which is a very slow walk, but we make it eventually. After some planning, we decide that Greymond will toss over the head near the Golem body and hope that the body picks up the head and puts it's head back on.

Greymond throws the golem head and lo and behold the body picked up the head and put it back into the head socket. It is strange though, when Greymond threw the head, quite a few of his hairs fell off from his beard/head. The golem does a double blink and walks up to Greymond as if he is the new owner. We decide to name it Tinny Tim.

Otis and Greymond both attempt to hug Tinny Tim but the golem pulls back it's leg both times before their hug connects. Definitely not a loving Golem.

Now that the Golem isn't destroying the building and is complete again, Otis returns back to his original goal of finding a book he saw in a previous vision, both Hirakus and Greymond help in his search.

After searching for a while, Hirakus finds a tattered looking spell book written in another language. He then attempts a comprehend languages ritual which includes drawing some strange glyphs on the floor for some time. While he is doing that, Velin offers to help but we mention that Hirakus is already working on a ritual, so we will let him finish.

Once the ritual completes, Hirakus can read the unknown language in the book to discover a slew of magical spells and another phrase needed for the ritual of the Octed. "Third, a burnt palm loosens the tongue. Shed a secret about yourself for all to hear"

Since there could be other trinkets in the rubble, most of the crew continues searching. While searching, Tinny Tim follows Greymond, blocking our view of him, not sure if he found anything or not. Otis and Hirakus on the other hand do discover a couple trinkets. Otis finds a cube that turns out to be a Cube of Force after identifying it. Hirakus finds a Rope that he identifies as the Rope of Entanglement.

While most were searching through the rubble, Ishamael seemed shaken up from the Well encounter with the five headed dragon and sat near the entrance, he noticed some more of the Nothics we saw near the grove of trees in the caves scurrying around.

We searched the rubble a while longer but after finding nothing we decide we found all that was there and make our way to the Tower of Necromancy.

When we arrive at the tower, Otis comments that the door looks like a dildo and calls it a Dildoor, the mind in that man is a mystery to me sometimes. Otis opens the door and I walk side by side with into the room to find a bunch of hands and a lot of bodies with hands cut off. On a bloodied table is another one of the one eyed creatures, a Nothic if I recall.

Out of the blue, a jar with a smiley face drawn on it containing a brain and a lab coat starts talking to us. We don't understand what it is says, so we ask Professor mustache to translate. The smiley brain jar introduces itself as Lawrance, then asked us if we are participating in the ritual. Otis ask if the ritual is to give Greymond a Cyclops eye jokingly, to which Lawrance tells us he is trying to master the brain transfer technique. Lawrance again asks us if we will help with the brain transfer procedure.

Otis agrees to help if Lawrance will help us with the ritual of the Octed, to which Lawrance agrees. Otis spits on his hand and reaches out to shake on the deal. Ishamael does not seem interested in the procedure and walks away from us for a bit.

As we begin to start the procedure, a few hands come over and hold down the top and bottom of the Nothic on the table. Lawrance asks Greymond and I to help also. Greymond helps with holding down the Nothic and I will help with attempting to cut the scalp. Lawrance tells us there is also a paralyzing poison in a cabinet, which Velin acquires for us and Lawrance applies the paralyzing agent.

We begin the procedure, Otis standing by the Nothics head instructs me where to cut the scalp. As I am cutting, I had a slight itch in my nose that caused me to slightly deviate from the expected cutting path, and I heard a strange squishy sound that didn't sound right. After cutting, Lawrance tells us that I killed it but felt we were cutting in the correct spot. Lawrance mentions that is the furthest he has gotten before, we win some and lose some...

Lawrance offers to put our brains into a jar, to which Otis politely declines. Otis then ask since we helped with the ritual, if he will help us with our ritual. Lawrance tells us to go upstairs to meet the master.

As we enter the new floor of the tower, we see bones strewn across the floor with luminescent fungus. And a green gem sone buried in the bones. All of a sudden Greymond is struck by something, unbeknownst to us. He barks at us to "Get out of my way" and quickely grabs the green gem in the bones and then goes to the other side of the room. Greymond starts digging through the rubble to find a little diamond.

Otis backs up to the crew and tells us that Greymond is acting strange, Greymond then proceeds to start a ritual with the items he retrieved, which is when Otis, Ishamael, and I rush forward to stop Greymond, I punch him in hopes that it will knock him out of the trance he is in, Greymond responds back in a language we don't understand. Hirakus asks Velin to pull out Professor mustache to translate for us again. Ishamael demands that Greymond stop doing the ritual but Greymond is determined.

Otis and Ishamael Interrogate the possessed Greymond to find out that they are trying to get their body and confirms that it does not intend to hurt Greymond. Since we know that Greymond does not like magic, Ishamael offers his own body to be possessed instead. The possessed Greymond agrees to the terms and passes over the possession to Ishamael.

Greymond returns to normal, but he is still holding the green gem and diamond and hands it over to the possessed Ishamael. Ishamael moves to where Greymond is and proceeds to continue the ritual asking us to leave him alone.

While waiting, Velin starts looking around the room amazed by the fossils she finds.

Possessed Ishamael starts drawing stuff on the floor and asks us how long has it been? Apparently what ever is possessing people last remembers the city falling and being trapped in the gem. Ishamael ask us if we turned on all the towers, Velins says we have only done 3 towers. Ishamael asks us to return back to one of the Divination tower and get some information from the master of divination.

After some back and forth, we decide to split the party, Otis, Greymond, and I will remain to monitor Ishamael and Velin, Hirakus, and Jesus will go talk to the high diviner.

Just as they were leaving, a ominous evil voice starts speaking to Velin: "I know you're in this city. Levistus tells me everything. I'm so thrilled that you decided to do my own homework. Didn't have to lift a finger in dealing with that pesky god trying to keep all of this land's secrets secure. And you left the front door open. And the walkway clear. Thanks. I was getting a bit worried about the meddling of my master's jailer. But thanks to you and your group, that dragon and its controller was not of my concern. And I really want to thank you for gathering up all of that black ice. With it, my connection, my people's connection, to my master is greater than ever. My powers amplified. All it took was dealing with a few weak dwarves. You know, back at the Brotherhood, everyone was so happy for an old broad like you to learn up on gradeschool magic. Some of us were naturally gifted, born with the abilities. You come from a wealthy family and bought your way in. You didn't earn the honor. I bet you had barely anything to do with your current achievements. Stumbling your way into success. I've served Levistus since the day I was born. I am made in his image. Why are you even here? Because of me and overhearing my mission. The magic in this city is for me and my master. This is what my entire life has been leading to. It is my birth right. Go lie down in a ditch and stay out of my way."

Hirakus and Velin return back to us mention they saw a bunch of forces coming to us and that Averice has arrived, what we will do next, time will tell!
