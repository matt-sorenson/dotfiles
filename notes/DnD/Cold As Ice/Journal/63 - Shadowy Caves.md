# 63 - Shadowy Caves

## üìÖ 25th of Uktar, 2:44am; inside Caves of Hunger

We continue east along the tunnel and almost immediately come across some shadowy figures in the room ahead, some almost at ground level and some up high.

Combat starts.

One approaches us and Hirakas releases a pair of Eldritch Blasts, almost killing (?) it. Vellynne follows up with a Chill Touch, but it seems to have no effect. Otis attacks another one that appears in front of us, then casts Spiritual Weapon behind that creature, killing it. Thod√ºrr runs up to attack the creatures, screaming incoherently as he runs. A few more shadows come up to attack Thod√ºrr, and I swear he looks a lot less buff than usual. He checks his junk for some reason, then the Shield Guardian casts Haste on me.

I attack & kill one of the shadows, but try too hard to avoid hitting Thod√ºrr and miss the next one. Ishamael casts Haste again on Otis and Thod√ºrr. Another shadow comes over to join the party and goes after me. Vellynne manages to poison one of them, however that works. Otis now casts Spirit Guardians as an area of effect around us. The Spiritual Weapon doesn't manage to do anything this time.

Thod√ºrr's voice starts cracking, and we all look at him a little confused. But he kills 2 of them. One of the shadows gets hurt from a Spirit Guardian. The Shield Guardian advances a bit.

I kill a shadow and move up to attack one more outside of the Guardians' circle. Hirakas uses Eldritch Blasts to finish the last one.

Combat Ends.

We head back to the magical room of rejuvenation and take a short rest. I attune to the Ring of the Ram.

Thod√ºrr keeps checking his loincloth for some reason. He seemed worried.

We take a southern route and enter a large room with a collapsed tower laying on its side, as well as a large hole in the floor.

"Sideways is just halfway upside-down."

Otis ladles some stew over a frozen chest and manages to melt it enough to open. Inside are 2 superior potions of healing. Thod√ºrr and I both take one.

Ishamael uses a drift globe to investigate the geometry of the hole.

The group discusses the mystery of orientation.

We loop back around the maze-like corridors and continue on exploring where we haven't been yet.

Upon entering a seemingly empty cave, everyone but me starts acting strangely hungry. I pause at the sudden change in behavior. It might be some magical nonsense taking over them.

We move on to the east, and this room has very large icicles almost touching the ground. There are 3 other exits.

Otis summons a badger from the bag of tricks. Ishamael summons a giant elk, which I don't think is going to fit in any of the tunnels.

We see something moving ahead and try to follow. Might have been a kobold?

In another room, we see kobolds climbing on the walls. Their eyes look pure red, which seems unusual. Another one appears behind us.

Combat starts.

Thod√ºrr attacks the one behind the party, dealing some damage. One jumps down to attack me and fails, but another bites me.

I attack one, shove it away, then relocate behind another kobold.
Hirakas sends Eldritch Blasts to 2 enemies, but doesn't seem to do much damage this time.
Otis casts Spirit Guardians, and we are all hypnotized by the light.
Kobolds try to attack Otis but don't do much.
The Shield Guardian winds up and punches, dealing moderate damage.
A kobold attacks Thod√ºrr and affects him the same way it affected me.
The elk we spawned deals bludgeoning damage to a kolbold near it.
Ishamael hastes us again.
Vellynne confirms that the balls are where the balls should be.
Thod√ºrr executes Operation Ball Buster and busts some balls.
I try staking 2 of the kobolds in the heart with crossbow bolts, and to my surprise they fall down, incapacitated.
Hirakas casts a lightning bolt at a group of them, killing one of them.
Otis attacks with a warhammer, killing the last kobold in this room.

Combat ends.

We move on to another room full of icicles.
