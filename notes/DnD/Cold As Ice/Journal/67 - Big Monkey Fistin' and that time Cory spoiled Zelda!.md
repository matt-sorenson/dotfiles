# 67 - Big Monkey Fistin' and that time Cory spoiled Zelda!

It's been a minute since the last time I became a giant ape, but here we go again.

As we exit from the corridor where we planned our attack against the giant centipede worm creatures called remorhaz, Velin and Hirakus magically attack them while Ishamael turns Greymond and I into giant apes.

Both of us giant apes rush in but what our ape brains forgot, we can't see in the dark like we can when we are dwarves. Luckily, ape Greymond manages to pound one of the smaller remorhaz, but for touching the creature, his fist was singed.  Some how these creatures are both living in a freezing cave but also are hot as hell.

The mama remorhaz, not happy with ape Greymond smashing her baby, moves on him, biting him and holds him in her mouth.

Otis moves into the room and provides some light then orders his celestial to attack the smaller remorhaz, killing it.

Ishamael's shield guardian cast haste on Ape me, with that new bump of energy, I jump across a pool of water, but out of range of Otis's light and without it I can't see. I try moving forward towards the mama remorhaz but am blocked from moving forward, which I back up from and to throw rocks at, but nothing connects.

As light starts coming into the chamber, we start to seem more baby remorhaz coming from the north part of the room.


Ape Greymond on the other hand is still trying to break free of the mama remorhaz bite, does manage to break free, but the creature again bites him and holds to him again in its mouth.

Otis asks Hirakus to bring headsquid over to him, to which he agrees, then Otis makes it so headsquid is a giant source of light for the whole crew.

Now that I have light, I can see a smaller remorhaz in front of me, so I beat it to death with my monkey fists. I then move up to the mama and proceed to start beating it.

All the while the smaller remorhaz are trying to attack the celestial and I but they can't seem to land a blow.

Hirakus, Velin, and Ishamael all start casting magic against the mama remorhaz dealing a nice blow.

Ape Greymond, who seemed to be very angry about being pinned by this creatures mouth, punched so hard it went right through the mama remorhaz's body. He then turned to one of the last remaining smaller remorhaz and landed a blow on it.

Otis and his celestial/flaming sword thingy also attacks the creature.

I walk up to the last remaining remorhaz, pound it twice and my second punch goes through the mouth/throat and I grab its insides and pull it through its mouth killing it.

We start exploring around, we find a pool that has some eggs in it, my clumsy ape feet break some of the eggs destroying them but Otis takes one of the eggs and stores it in his bag of holding. We plan on using this creature for our battle arena.

Eventually I return back to a normal dwarf. Otis cooks one of the other eggs to see how they taste, I try it out with Otis, it has a wonderful flavor but Otis thought it was only ok, clearly dwarves have better taste buds.

As we explore the chambers around the remorhaz nest, one of them makes it seem like everyone has black worms coming out of their ears, that was super weird.

While exploring, Otis jokingly orders his rat to bite me, to which I land a massive attack leaving nothing behind. That will teach him to bite me ;p.

As we explore, we find a tunnel that goes on for 30 ish min which arrives in a giant cavern with bioluminescent moss, I know this place, this is the under dark, a very dangerous place that I would love to explore, but that will need to be another journey for another day.

We make our way back through the tunnel we came from, and head back to the grove of trees where we met Greymonds girlfriend. At this point Greymond has grown to almost 7 feet tall, so unfair... I wish I could be that tall, damn short dwarf genes.

While asking Greymonds girlfriend for help as to why he is growing so tall, I begin to explore and wonder into a room full of creatures that attack me.

Being alone, I rage and begin attacking and killing them, I yell out to the crew to let the know I got myself into trouble incase things go south, but turns out I was probably fine on my own. The crew came regardless and helped me clean up the mess I had gotten into.

After the short fight, we discuss how to remove this "curse" that seems to have fallen upon Greymond that was causing him to grow, we try a few things but nothing succeeds.

Before we head off in another tunnel, we explore one last chamber to find that we smell what we failed at. I smelled the one time I made mead that had a rat die in it and rotted for a few months. Otis smelled bad stew, Ishamael smells the place he had his brain sucked out. And Greymond smelled failure, which reminds him of stinky sweat.

We decide to take a short break and at the end of it, Greymond is 9 ft tall.
