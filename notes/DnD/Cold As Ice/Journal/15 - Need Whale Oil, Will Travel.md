# 15 - Need Whale Oil, Will Travel

## ðŸ“… 23rd of Marpenoth, 05:38

We woke up after spending the night with Garett and Kiegan.  Ishamael looked like he'd be run over by a dogsled, so I offered him some stew as a warm compress.  He declined, but ended up joining everyone else in a nice stew breakfast.

We headed out to the market to look for some adventure and ran into an eager-looking half-elf.  She introduced herself as Helka Jaggorath and wanted us to escort her out to the Sea of Moving Ice to purchase some whale oil from an 'interesting creature'.   After some group finagling we talk her into giving us 100 gold from our payment upfront â€“ enough to grab a couple more sled dogs.

Hirakas needed some paper goods for some sort of his black magic witchery so we headed over to a little shop called Triglio.  The shopkeep was a weird old man with a weird old hand, flat as a pancake.  His hand was so weird I felt compelled to ask about it = he said it had been squished between two boats.  He also said it was still good for scratching, a sentiment that I deeply respected.

Hirakas got his paper goods, and we enquired about purchasing some dogs before we lft â€“ he pointed us in the direction of the stables.  We headed that way and learned that the weird dude running the place had five dogs for sale.   Thodurr decided that he wanted to interview the dogs himself before we made our purchase, so he prepared the ritual that lets him speak beast-talk.  He ended up planting himself in a corner and massaging his nipples, all the while making this weird maoning noise that slowly turned into a dogly yowl.  It was a bizarre sight, but as I myself am often accused of having 'non-traditional' interactions with others I felt I had no room to judge him.

With the ritual completed Thodurr started chatting up the dogs.  It was a lot of barking, whimpering and groaning but at the end he'd picked out the two he felt would work the best with us.  He said one really loved food and the other really loved running, so I suggested the most natural names that came to mind â€“ Runny and Eaty.  We got them hooked up to our sleds and headed back to Helka.

Once her preparations were complete we left town together(09:45).  We took the road out of town and ended up passing through Bremen, but did not make any stops as we went through town.  After traveling north for some time(13:45) we ended up running into this weird domed ice structure near a fire.  We stop our sleds and take a look â€“ seeing a small group of little rat monkeys down below â€“ I recognized them as Kobolds, having run into their like before.  Ishamael attempted to talk to them using his mind-messaging, but it only seemed to confuse and work them up.  I was a little excited at the prospect of fighting these things once I saw them getting excited, but the others were eager to move on so I did not try to force things.  Battle will come when Tempus sees fit.

That night we made camp out on the ice.  I had not felt very clean for a while, so I gave myself the only warm bath I could make happen out on the ice â€“ in the stew pot.  I thought I was being clever, but Ishamael was not keen on the idea and suggested that we avoid more bodies(dead or alive) inside the stew pot going forward.  I find the old man to be squeamish at times, but since this stew pot belongs to all of us so I'll just need to figure out another way to take a warm bath on the ice next time.

That morning we took off for our destination.  As we rode, Hirakas was writing furiously into that book he carries around everywhere.  I've long suspected he has a hidden sensitive side and can only imagine that he was writing about his feelings.  I respect that he's so in touch with himself and decided to leave him to his writing as we pressed forward.
