# 34 - Snake Tits

## ðŸ“… 7th of Uktar, 11:50; The Talking Moose

We went to the stable and Thodurr bought 4 more saddles for the giant linen elks.

We went back to the Talking moose and Ishamael & Copper studied the Drift Globe we found aboard the Dark Douches

In discussion with copper we discover the little statuette we found at the Black Cabin was some sort of magical helper? We decide to try to sell it too.

We then decided to head out towards termalaine, it takes us 1 hour to get there.

## ðŸ“… 7th of Uktar, 13:17; Termalaine

We head to the town hall to find the towns market. Ishamael goes in to ask. The lady at the front desk gives us direction to the gem sellers.

### Begin Intermission

Wherein we talk about Skillet & Ice Cream on hot dogs

### End Intermission

At the gem dealer's we find the old merchant and after much haggling come away muchâ€¯less gems and much more gold.

Otis uses the ruby dust I purchased to cast continual flame on my lantern and I give Ishamael my remaining lamp oil. And we head out towards Bryn Shander

## ðŸ“… 7th of Uktar, 16:35; Bryn Shander

We reach Bryn Shander and some go into Blackiron Blades for some more trade while I stay outside with the carts and animals.

After a while they come back out as vendors start to clean up their stalls for the night.

We head over to rendirils for some more trading.

Ishamael looks for some supplies and inquires about a tailor and I inquire about any spellcasters who may be willing to train me in magic in exchange for the spellbook we previously found, he suggests the priest (nishan) at the church of the morning lord and gives some directions.

We then discuss selling the remaining trinkets we have, and inspect his magical goods for possible trade. We get a cape of protection and some eagle eye gogles along with some gold for the remainder of our gold.
