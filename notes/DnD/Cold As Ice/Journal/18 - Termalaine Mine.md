# 18 - Termalaine Mine

ðŸ“… 29th of Marpenoth, 7:57am

We're in the dungeon area of the town hall in Termalaine. After finishing our "interview" with Nars, we head upstairs and wait for the town speaker to finally arrive. He takes us back to his office to talk. We bring up the gem mine, and the speaker says it's been closed for a couple of 10-day because of a missing miner, and because it has been overrun with kobolds. Otis flexed his muscles and coerced him to double the offer to 100gp, plus whatever gems we find inside our ours to keep.

We ask about the man-eating moose, but didn't get much information.

Finally, we ask about the prisoner and negotiate a plan to take care of the mine while Nars is transferred to a cabin just northeast of the wooded area by Lonelywood.

We head over to the gem mine, in front of which is a sign that says 'Kobolds Only'. As we enter, we notice gear, pickaxes, footprints, and other signs of relatively recent work. We pick a pathway at random and travel down, and soon come across a bottomless pit with a sketchy wooden platform on the south side. Hirakas sends out Headsquid to scout the area, and notices a pair of kobolds underneath the platforms. We try to command them to jump off into the pit, but it didn't work. As Plan B, the magic users are able to shove them off instead.

We anchor ourselves to the wall since we don't trust this platform, but walking across, it's surprisingly stable. We make our way across to the other side and find a bucket lift that decends to a level below. We take it one at a time, then proceed down a short hallway and encounter a pair of kobolds standing over a dead rat. Seeing them as not a very large threat, we rush in but miss the first several attacks. Eventually we fix our aim and dispatch the kobolds without issue.

We double back and investigate the north path from the bottom of the bucket lift, and encounter a very strange creature [Grell] toward the top of the tall ceiling. We fire some crossbow bolts at it and do some damage, then after a few more attacks it tries to come down and attack, but thanks to Tasha's Mind Whip, it can't actually do anything. We eventually kill it, a tougher creature than the kobolds.

We continue on our original path deeper into the mine, and unexpectedly run into 3 kobolds who surrender and want to talk to us. They tell us they're refugees and just want to work an honest living. My instincts tell me something is strange with the kobold I'm talking to [Trex]. I don't think they'll be welcome in the town's society, but we agree to escort them up the surface and have the town speaker make the decision. On the way up, we clear out the rest of the mine, including one very overkilled rat.

Upon exiting, the group discusses what to do with the kobolds. Some ideas include:

- Take them with us
- Negotiate with the town speaker to see if there's a place in society for them
- Give them a place to stay at our old fortress, in exchange for them watching over it
- We're still suspicious of Trex, however.
