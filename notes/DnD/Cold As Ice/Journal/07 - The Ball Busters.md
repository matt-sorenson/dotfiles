# 07 - The Ball Busters

As we returned from partially explored northern section of the Dark dwarf
stronghold and getting "great" intel from the goats of the remaining enemies
in the stronghold.

I started to ponder why did the dark dwarves refuse to talk use before we
stormed the Stronghold. Am I really that bad at talking to people. How is
someone who wants to make his mead known throughout all lands going to succeed
when he fails to stroke up a conversation from a cousin race. Sigh. I must
really must suck at talking to people. I really should leave that up to
Ishameal or Otis from now on.

While I was deeply pondering this, our party began exploring the southern
section of the Dark Dwarf Stronghold. Now I know better then to be distracted
while in a dangerous area, but it was really bothering me.... Hirakas and I
open up a door and find two dark dwarves waiting to attack us and 4 or 5 tall
disfigured fungai like humanoids begin moving towards is from what looked like
little dungeon cells.

As I wake up pondering, Hirakas takes a hit from one of the Fungai Humans but
immediately turns that creature into a pile of ash.

The party in the backline, who were paying attention, immediately spring into
action as Ishamel and Jartha attack.

And as if I didn't learn my lesson about mindless pondering, I see two of
Jartha's arrows hit one of the dark dwarves, that lady dwarf is amazing. My
heart was pounding so fast, I wanted to turn around and give her hug her for
saving me, but mid thought, the two dark dwarves enlarged and all I saw was
their war picks as they bashed me to the floor and all I remember is black.

During my short slumber, it felt I was about to knock on death's door, but all
of a sudden life came back to me, I open my eyes to see Ishameal over my prone
body healing me with his amazing magic. Man I owe him a mead!

Ishameal backs out to safety behind Red and Otis, and I now lookup as one of
the enlarged dark dwarfs charges my prone body to attack Otis.

Then I see a horrendous sight, this dark dwarf straddling me has his dark
genitalia exposed. I standup under the enlarged dark dwarf, and RAGE! I take a
mighty swing at the exposed genitalia but in the most embarrassing way, I
manage to completely miss the target RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE!

I am just going to pretend that never happened, hopefully Otis didn't notice,
he will make fun of me for the rest of time.

I move behind the dark dwarf but am now surrounded by four fungai humans who
don't look happy to see me.

As battle ensues, Otis lands a mighty flail blow on one of the enlarged dark
dwarves, right in its dark genitalia. The flail goes right into the middle its
giant ball sack and he pulls it out spewing blood and testicle blood everywhere.

I think he may have noticed my failed genitalia attack from earlier, I'm never
gonna live this down.

Otis, please describe your attack just like you did earlier during our v chat
please ;p

Combat continues with Jartha, the love of my life, again landing a very precise
shot severing the ball sack  from the remaining enlarge dark dwarf. The sack
immediately shrinks back to normal dwarf size as it falls to the ground


Graymond moves forward and chops one of the fungai humanoids face off.

Hirakas, which is a beast of a warlock, blast another fungai humanoid in the
face as its limp body fell to the ground

Ishameal reachs out with his hand and freezes another
fungai humanoid from the bottom up

And lastly Greymond lunges his sword into the last fungai humanoids face.

At last the room was sanitized of these vile creatures.

After some light recovery and distribution of loot, of which I took a new
shield and war pick from.

We find a stair way. But before I risk taking the stairs, I am going to get me
some answers from those Goats. They didn't tell me about the fungai humanoids.
I chopped of one of the fungai heads, picked it up, and returned to the goats.
Otis followed closely behind, probably to laugh at me talking to the goats or
looking at a chance kill more goats. Who knows with that guy.

My conversation didn't go well with the goats, I was rather annoyed and angry
about the previous lack of information, and I took it out unfairly on them.
They didn't deserve that. But I need to work on this communicating with animals
thing, these creatures are exceptionally stupid.

After that slight detour, we began exploring more of the southern
section of the stronghold.

We find no other then most of the stolen goods from Caer Coneg minus the lantern.

After thoroughly searching the southern section, we returned to the main
entrance with the goats and begin exploring the last remaining western section
of the stronghold.

The party wanted to scout ahead before moving forward this time. Again I
volunteered to go along with Jartha to scout ahead. Any chance to be with Jartha.
We sneak forward, Jartha right behind me, but this time I'm trying to pay
attention to the situation instead of dreaming of Jartha.

As we enter a new room, a lever on a wall magically gets pulled and a metal gate
drops between Jartha and I. I am cut off from the rest of the party.

I hear a voice telling me in dwarvish that I am weak and small and I am then
flung against a wall and again... knocked prone, but not KOed this time.

Hearing the ruckus the party runs catches up to us. As they arrive, the one who
knocked me to the ground shows himself. Its another dark dwarf but larger and
probably the boss of the other dark dwarves. He looks angry and has evil intent
in his eyes. He enlarges himself and prepares to attack

Everyone behind the gate does ranged attacks against the dark dwarf but
Ishameal, that genius, uses his mind to pull the lever and open the gate.
Man I really owe him a mead.

We all attack this dwarf, itâ€™s a slaughter, he has no chance. I finally end
this dwarves life by swinging my might axe from his nether regions to his face,
slicing his genitalia in half along the way. At least this time I didn't miss!

After defeating hopefully the last dark dwarf in this stronghold, we continued
exploring the last remaining room in the western section of the stronghold to
find the Northern Light Lantern from Caer Coneg.

On a desk, we found a note about someone's brother, named Durth, is going to be
at a ferry near east haven. Maybe something to look into.

We also find some dark pieces of glass that are about dagger size, we think they
are called sharliin? Greymond stores them for now since he maybe able to make
some impressive weaponry with them, time will tell.

I switch out the war pick from earlier to grab the cooler war pick that Daddy
Dwarf was swinging earlier.

We return to the entrance with the goats, bring the dogs inside, close the doors
and bring up the draw bridge. We finally take a well earned rest after clearing
this strong hold of its filth.

We wake up in the morning to notice a terrible smell from the dead bodies we
had left. We began dragging them out of the stronghold and rolling them down a
large slop as the formed giant snow balls.

As the party watched, I then began creating a master art piece of a grotesque
warning sign to keep people away from the strong hold. I make three giant snow
man out of the giant snowballs rolled from the dead bodies from the stronghold.
Arms and legs and heads sticking out at all sorts of obscene angles. Let it be
warning to all that try to oppose us.

Otis, adds one last cherry on top, exposed the genitalia of the ogre we had
slain and smashed them in!

And that is how we became The Ball Busters
