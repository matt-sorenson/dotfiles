# 83 - Iriolarthas is dead?

ðŸ“… 28th of Uktar, 5:32am; Spire of Iriolarthas

Otis tells Iriolarthas "I thought you'd be taller." Followed by "I'm gonna make you a hat, have anything to say about that?"

He seems to be eye fucking Otis

Vellynne pipes up and suggestions that professor orb could translate for us.

Otis starts talking through professor orb to translate, but decides to cast comprehend language so translations only have to go 1 way.

- He asks are you Iriolo? it nods it's head yes
- Can you speak? It shakes it's head no
- Does your brain work? It squeeks it's jaw at him

Staff on table looks to be a staff of power

Graymond stepped forward and grabbed the staff, which appears to anger Iriolarthas, combat starts

- Iriolarthas attacks but it doesn't seem to do anything.
- Thodurr jumps down and rages at the skull & attacks it, he hits it hard.
- It seems to reach with some sort of thing and dumps a bunch of dust out
- The shield guardian attacks a nothic
- I finish the nothic off.
- I spawn a tentacle to block off one of the stairs.
- A nothic tries to push thodurr down a hole
- Lynn seems to be freaked out and misses her shot
- Ishamael hastes some folks
- Nothic fails at trying to hit the tenticle
- Graymond jumps down and kills the nothic that attacked thodurr
- Otis jumps down and rushes up to the skull, summons some sort of buff celestrial
- His Celestrial proceeds to attack the skull (lots of jokes around skull fucking)
- The skull releases some sort of skreach, scarring everyone on the lower floor
- Thodur yells something at the skull & moved away from the skull a bit
- I attack Iriolarthas doing some good damage and resummon henticle and have it attack, but that misses
- Iriolarthas somehow seems to make the building drop 10 feet droping everyone but me & thodurr to the floor.
- Lynn stands up and attacks but misses
- Ishamael stands up and fired an attack off at the skull
- The nothic attacks gray and starts to ascend the stairs.
- Gray moves forward and attacks the nothic
- Otis summons a spiritual sword & attacks Iriolarthas killing it and finishing off the last nothic

I take the skull (minus a couple teeth that otis takes)

  We find that the word `Saldrinar` will remove us from the room & the word `Olostin` permanantly deactivates the shield.

I spend an hour attuning to the staff of power, shortly after we all notice the tower shuttering and see a yellow light (like the ythryn mythallar) coming from below the tower.

*we should just drop a tarrasque on them?*
