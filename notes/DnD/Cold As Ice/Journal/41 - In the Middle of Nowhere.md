# 41 - In the Middle of Nowhere

## üìÖ 10th of Uktar

Graymond and Hirakas spent some time checking the pockets of the scattered goblin bodies finding 83 gold in total. Meanwhile, Thodurr and I try the series of levers and pullies the goblins are using to hold up the Shield Guardian. There‚Äôs some mangled crossings and knots from the goblins that is too confusing to make them work. I suggest we just tie our own rope and cut the cords, but Thodurr jostles our captured ‚Äúgoblin‚Äù and suggests perhaps he could work the pullies instead.

Spellix Romwod, as he calls himself, agrees and gives us his life story up to this point. Goblins ate his mates in some sort of contrived avalanche which captured them. Spellix got away and then followed the goblins back and infiltrated them with his goblin outfit. He‚Äôs been living in this ruse for the past many years and helped the goblins build this fort of theirs.

We get the Shield Guardian down with Spellix‚Äôs help and after a little trial and error, and some ‚Äúaid‚Äù from Otis, I quickly activate the construct. The symbols on the amulet appear to be the same symbols on the Shield Guardian. Spellix mentions the goblins called it Truq and we find that name rather fitting. Truq does appear to be more rustic and perhaps from the Netheres times.

It seems the goblins are scavengers and they found Truq somewhere in Icewind Dales. We also confirm that these goblins here were the ones that we fought off a month or so ago who had the polar bears.

I spend some time to learn more about how Truq works while Thodurr spends his time speaking with the goats and convinces three to come along with us. It does seem like the few goblins left in the healer‚Äôs huts might have been hungry for stew, but none felt comfortable coming out to talk with us.

I head to the front gate with Truq and the goats while the rest of the crew snag the rest of Spellix‚Äôs belongings and the rest of the goblin treasures which was just a heavy egg chest with buttons and doodads locking it.

Spellix wishes to join us in returning to civilization. I require that he step on his face mask and shatter it to prove that he does wish to cut ties with the goblins and if he does, we‚Äôll let him come and untie him. He gladly accepts and stomps his mask.

Before heading out we Spellix helps us craft some skis for Truq to speed up his travel time by tearing down some of the goblin outposts. Truq then skis down with me on the back to our carts in spectacular time!

We head back along The Redrun and make it back to the Ten Trails hunting a bit around for headaches. After some time heading south, back tracking, and then heading east towards our estimate where Sunblight is we find a point where the headaches are at the point of pain and retreat for the night.

Being close to Sunblight, we decide it might be best to spend a night in Dougan‚Äôs Hole; which just might have been easier to just sleep in our tents... We arrive and find out that the town itself is in the boonies and the people look a little off. We convince the one couple to let us stay the night by trading some goat milk and stew for a room inside. We take some precautions and have someone on watch during the night.

We chat with Spellix about the dangers that lay ahead of us and that if he chooses to, he could make his way up to Lonelywood to the Talking Moose if he‚Äôs in need of a job. Otis gives him some details on the ‚Äúnight with the mirror‚Äù to have Shanry know that we sent him. He thinks about it and heads off to Good Mead.

We then make a quick stop in what seems to be a boat shop of sorts. We make a barter for fish by ‚Äúfixing‚Äù their boat and giving them some stew. The lad agrees. Which was much better than digging another stew trough in the ground.

We make quick haste back to the spot of the headaches.
