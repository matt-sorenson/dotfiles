# 00 – Thodürr's Mead of the Gods

This cold hellscape seems to seep into these old bones. Another day and still
no luck finding out any information on where they could be. I know somewhere
here in Bryn Shander there's the answers I seek. Iliana, Elaine, and Talia I
hope you're safe and warm. Anywhere is warmer than here. Let this punishment
be my own.

I walk with a hurried pace back to my inn. Trying desperately to keep my hands
warm. As I round the courtyard at the center of Bryn Shander I see two oddly
matched companions. A deer eyed mountain dwarf and a backwater alley man of the
cloth who's shouting at bystanders to try this dwarf's mead. Something about these
two bring a sense of fresh air into this stale town. And boy was that drunken
cleric, Otis, right! Such a fine mead. Margaret, the Inn Keeper of Northlook,
would surely give these two room and board for the quality. Thodürr, the
craftsman of the fine mead was speechless but gratefully nods his head.

We arrive at Northlook. I make call for Margaret. Looking around the common room
there seems to be a couple of other stragglers sheltering from the endless night
and frost. A dragonborn who I feel I've seen before protecting cargo and what
appears to be a hill dwarf staring intently at a bundle on the table, sometimes
nervously looking around. Margaret comes out of the kitchen and proclaims that
he's not Margaret but Scramsax. I could have sworn his name was Margaret. Scramsax
reminds me that the wench's name is Margaret. I apologize, and say my age must be
getting to me and quickly move onto pitching Thodürr's mead before I let my mind
ponder any further. Otis leans into the pitch with some flair of clerical gestures
calling on the will of the gods. Scramsax is sold on our tale and tries the mead.
He wants to start selling this mead at his inn and asks what's the name of the
mead. Otis chimes in, "mead of the gods!". But let's give credit where credit is
due. "Scramsax, you should call this Thodürr's Mead of the Gods.", as I gesture a
hand towards the shy mountain dwarf.
