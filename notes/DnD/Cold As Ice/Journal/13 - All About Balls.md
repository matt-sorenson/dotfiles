# 13 - All About Balls

## ðŸ“… 21st of Marpenoth, 4:36pm

Level 4 Reached

ThodÃ¼rr heads to the stables and buys another sled (20gp). He then heads to the "bathroom" to conduct some "business", but I know what's up. We head back to the pens and interview one of the dogs, Chopper. The dog really seems to like balls for some reason. The shopkeeper tells us about some "standing wolves", about twice the size of us. We agree to buy Chopper (50gp) and continue on our way.

We travel to Bryn Shander. With our new sleds, the trip is much faster. The familiar sights of glowing reindeer appear in the distance as we ride along. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw something fly up into the sky, but it may have been a trick of the lantern light.

â€” Encounter â€”

We suddenly come across two hideous flying creatures that look like bird/reindeer hybrids. We start firing javelins and crossbow bolts at them, but they don't seem to hurt them very much. We keep the sleds going and continue attacking them from a distance, slowly but surely injuring them. They each dive-bomb different party members, but through some luck, we avoid taking any hits. Otis jumps off his cart, frantically throwing the reins to Hirakas and summoning a spiritual weapon that violently strikes one of the birds. ThodÃ¼rr manages to kill the one that was hexed and goaded by spiking a javelin right into its mouth.

The remaining creature tries again to attack Otis, but fails again to make contact. I jump off my sled as well and run back to help. But before I get there, Hirakas fires an Eldritch Blast and finishes it off.

Upon inspecting the dead bodies, we recognize them as Peryton. Chopper is excited for the hot balls that were cut off. We load both of the corpses onto the sleds and continue to Bryn Shander.

Upon reaching Bryn Shander, we walk to the opposite side of town to reach the stables. Nobody is awake at this hour, but Otis is determined to get in and makes the house shake. Every dog in town is woken up as a result and continue howling for 11 minutes. A sleepy shopkeeper (Belfast) eventually comes to the door and takes our business to board the dogs and store the sleds.

We go to the Northlook Inn and book 2 rooms (2sp x 2).

Long Rest

We wake up and eat breakfast. Ishamael seems to be under the weather today, however. Stopping by the town hall, I collect the remaining profit from the swords the clan produced (+24gp for Graymond). Sheriff Southwell brings us into another room and

Vaelish Gant led a raketeering group to smash up businesses around Bryn Shander.

Gant accused Speaker Shane of not being able to handle thugs around town and tried to take power for himself.

Mild magic user, trying to become town speaker

Locked him in a prison up north, a life sentence

Wants us to interview Gant in an effort to thwart any actions against Ten Towns

... high security prison in Revel's End

Gives us a permission slip for the prison

And a note for leverage (try not to use) that reduces his prison sentence

250gp if we come back with any useful information

Lord's Alliance runs the prison

We move on to Geldenstag's Rest on the east side of town, looking for the woman who tasked us with looking for the chwingas. We easily find Danaka at a table reading. Asking about the Perytons, it turns out their behavior was some kind of mating ritual they were engaged in. Apparently their shadow casts a humaniod shape instead of reflecting the shape of the creature, which we did not notice before.

Then we started sharing what we learned about the chwingas. She is very excited, and we move to the alleyway to introduce it.

She tells us about a particular recipe that uses crushed up dragon bones to produce a stew that has healing and cold-resistance properties. The bones are in short supply, but apparently some are available near a clan of goliaths far to the east.
