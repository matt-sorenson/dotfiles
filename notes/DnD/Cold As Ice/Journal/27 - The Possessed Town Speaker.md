# 27 - The Possessed Town Speaker

## ðŸ“… 4th of Uktar, 5:10pm

Today's journey, we are making our way back to Termalaine to confront Orius,
the town speaker, and Trex, the Kobold, about why they were both showing up at
the same spot in our magical mirror.

When we arrived, we make our way straight to the town speakers town hall
building, which was closed. But Otis being Otis knocks persistently on the door
to get someone's attention. Eventually a lady opens the door. That was her first
mistake... Otis and Ishamael then proceeded to intimidate and make demands to
this poor lady to get the information we need to solve this mystery

Eventually the lady tells us that Orius, the town speaker, has been acting
strange and that he had checked out late afternoon and is probably at his house.
She also told us that the Kobolds are working in the town hall.

Otis and Ishamael, stated that we needed to inspect the Kobolds to ensure they
were treated properly according to the previous agreements. Not sure how they
pull of these lies so smoothly, but a guard escorts them through the Town hall
to round up all of the Kobolds in the town hall and then we all headed to the
prison to interrogate the Kobolds about this nefarious scheme.

To our expectation, Trex is like a completely different person, and he was very
dumb, even dumber than a normal kobold. This basically confirms our suspicion
that something had possessed Trex and had moved on to Orius.

Before we confront the possessed town speaker, Otis asks the Kobolds to swear
to him that they told the truth.. One responded, "Fuck you... What you told me
to swear?"

Kobolds sure are dumb...

Otis tells the Kobolds that the checkup is completed and demand the guard
escort us to the town speakers house.

We arrived at the speaker's house and are allowed in and Otis tricks Orius into
telling us that he hates breakfast, when in fact we know he LOVES breakfast.
Basically confirming that Orius is indeed a different person and taken over by
something.

The guards that escorted us left and it was just us and Orius. Our group slowly
made our way to all the exits in the room to ensure that the possessed Orius
could not escape. "Orius" offers us tea and/or biscuits, but we told him we did
not want any.

Ishamael then proceeded to put his hand on Orius's forehead... Not sure what he
was trying to achieve, but maybe he is finally getting senile with his old age.
Orius is confused by Ishamaels action but the senior plays it off saying its
some town speaker greeting. Otis tells them to finish the town speaker greeting.
Orius then proceeds to his hand on Ishamaels head, then Ishamael looked like he
was trying to concentrate to sense something. I just remember, this being a
little weird.

After the awkward greeting, Otis comes straight out saying we know he isn't
Orius and that he is the same thing that was possessing Trex.

"Orius's" personality changed completely and what ever had taken over him had
decided to stop trying to pretend they are Orius. He ask us what we want. We
tell him we want information, who is he? Otis Threatens him to tell us but
"Orius's" is very cocky thinking we can't kill him. We assure him, we have
killed worse.

"Orius" tries arguing that he is no different from us. He is just improving his
body, like how I improved my muscles to be nice and strong. We aren't buying it.

Otis, then demands that what ever has taken over Orius try to take over him,
"Orius" obliges Otis and walks over to him and I see light leave Orius and move
into Otis. Otis was now under control of the spirit.

Our party began combat to try and rescue our dumbish friends from the pickle he
got himself into. I tried to grapple Otis, but he shoved me off, I was not
expecting that. Hirakus tries the same thing and succeeds, this probably means
I need to work out more...

The possessed Otis breaks free of Hirakus and drew his sword. Restraining Otis
wasn't going to work here, so we proceeded to bash Otis until he fell asleep,
hoping we could save him. "Otis" tries to attack back during this but hardly
touches us.

Finally Otis is knocked out by Greymond, and a ghost appears over Otis's body.
We proceed to attack this ghost until eventually Hirakus does his infamous
double eldritch blast, knocking the ghost into the bathroom and disintegrating
it.

After the battle, Ishamael bring Otis back to life and I give him a mead for
taking that beating from us. Orius wakes up after his possession, sees us and
is very surprised. We filled him in about the whole situation from the magic
mirror to the kobolds and the battle with the ghost. Orius then went to eat
some food and I gave him a pint of my fancy mead.

Orius invites us to eat at the Blue Clam on him and we are always down for free
food. Since Orius is so well known, he ask for a very large breakfast order
even though it was dinner time. Eventually a very large food order arrived of
chopped potatoes, eggs, pancakes, fish, honey and more. It was rather good.
Would come back again, I esp. enjoyed the fish on the pancakes with honey and
the followed up by some of my mead.

We have a light conversation about current events, but we already knew about
this Red Yeti near Caer Konig past Lac Denneshere.
