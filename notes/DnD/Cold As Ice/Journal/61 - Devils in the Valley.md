# 61 - Devils in the Valley

The trouble of the day starts off with our meeting of Sheriff Stockwell in the early morning at the Northlook. Our good Sheriff was sleeping at a table, with his arms resting on the table, and his head on his arms. It seemed he‚Äôs seen some sleepless nights as of late and catching some z‚Äôs when he can. He brings the news of a stalled shipment from Graymond‚Äôs family.

We eat stew and chat about our next order of business. We decide traveling to Graymond‚Äôs valley seems like a reasonable choice. We pick up the armor and weapons the boys ordered and check in on Gray‚Äôs people all at the same time.

As we arrive to the dwarven valley there is a landslide blocking off the one entrance of the cave where the forges and shardalin are. There‚Äôs also a noticeable lack of dwarves moving about.

Graymond finds one of his buddies, Storn. Storn mentions they‚Äôve gotten attacked. The shardalin drawn in some foul horned creatures and humanoids coated in ice. One of these humanoids still stands, dead, in a section of the collapsed tunnels.

Upon inspection up close we find this humanoid was wearing an amulet crafted of shardalin with a symbol of Levistus - one of the rulers of the nine hells. Their symbol is a black sword pointing down. Otis mentions that this would be a different faction of devils the grow dwarfs were working with. They were working for Asmodeus. Levistus was Asmodeus were mortal enemies.

Good dwarfs died trying to protect the vault, the shardalin, and most importantly their home. The large vault door stands melted open. Only the gauntlet, crown and the bodies of the corrupted kings remained. So many questions linger in the air. How did these devils know this shardalin was here? How do we track these evil creatures down? What could we do better next time?

We make a pact with the dwarven elder, Nomas. We put plans into motion on crafting a warded vault in the forests of Lonelywood. The location being right under our fighting arena. A group of dwarfs would be sent out to arrive by tonight. Hopefully there we‚Äôll shield civilians from future onslaught. Otis‚Äôs divine magic will ward the vault, and eventually the arena, with hallowed ground preventing entry of these fiends in the future. And hopefully our arena‚Äôs fighters would help us fight anything that that doesn‚Äôt cover.

Now for the who. ‚ÄúA horned, white, female barking orders. A red devilish man wearing green robes with brown fluffiness. The woman had an icy staff that shot ice.‚Äù, Storn described. Lynn marks the description of the female as the tiefling named Averrous, one of her Sisterhood colleagues. She is known to use gargoyles and crow familiars. The red tiefling is not known.

Our only knowledge of their location is they entered and left from the east. At least we learned a little bit about them. For instance, the icy humanoids seem to be in a constant state of frozen. Fire and warmth do not seem to touch them. Even in the blaze of a hot fire we scraped together the thing didn‚Äôt burn. Martial weapons are effective as proven by Otis smashing the creature‚Äôs head in.

I form a wall of stone in vault around the remaining shardalin artifacts and the amulet found on the ice spawn. Hopefully this will do until the new vault is made.

The boys collect their new gear and return their borrowed ones and we head out to more shopping, this time in Easthaven.

Easthaven seems to be struggling just like the dwarfs were. They were attacked too, but by that shardalin dragon. People seem to be homeless and in need of help all around the city.

We make our first stop at Rurdern‚Äôs Armory and strike a bargain to upgrade Otis‚Äôs armor to the finest of platemail. We get an excellent discount and I throw out the idea of Rurdern moving his shop to be right by the arena. Would be good for both our businesses and spending a bit of extra time crafting his shop won‚Äôt take much time at all. He agrees to check the place out in a ten days‚Äô time.

Our second stop is at Dingler‚Äôs Dingly Doots, the place where I picked up that excellent tea set. This time we were in search of supplies for Otis‚Äôs wards. Luckly Dingle had the Doots, one might say. Be buy the whole lot of everything Otis needed.

We check in with the speaker to see if there‚Äôs anything we could do around the city to help out. We, unfortunately, forgot that this man was the one who hired mercenaries to steal the stew pot from us. Well, we‚Äôll let bygones be bygones and get to the heart of the matter. We get the location of The White Lady Inn which has been set up as a community food kitchen to feed those in need.

We head out with the speaker in tow. I assume he has a guilty conscience of the unspeakable matter in our past and helps us feed the folks of Easthaven free stew. We make a makeshift stew trough and the citizens help. We tell the owner of The White Lady Inn that if they run out of stew to come let us know to refill.

We travel back to Lonelywood and I tell Shanry to let us know when the dwarfs awake before heading out to the vault area.

## üìÖ 24th of Uktar

we wake and prepare our journey to the Netheress.
