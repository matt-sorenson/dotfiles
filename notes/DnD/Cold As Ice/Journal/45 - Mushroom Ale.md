# 45 - Mushroom Ale?

Inside the dwarf fortress it seems all the dwarfs we’re meeting are not for mushroom ale and time keeps on ticking.

We halted the furthest elevator preventing dwarven movement throughout the fortress. Some armor in the room peaked Otis’s interest, but as he touched the suit it came to life and attacked. After “polishing” up the armor and throwing them into a corner for later we hurried along to the elevator near the entrance and take a ride up with Otis humming a tune.

At the top we jammed this elevator with a crowbar before some invisi-dwarfs spotted us and retreated. Mr. Badger lead the charge and followed their scent while my invisi-seeing eyes watched for an ambush. We quickly made work of these grow dwarfs who really worshiped “cogs”. Strange fellows. Well, Thodurr and Otis broken the chain of this other elevator shaft which echoed down it’s destruction.

It seems at the top there’s nothing but elevator shafts and no information on stopping the shardaline dragon. The only other things of note were more crazed hammer invisi-dwarfs and some love bird grow dwarfs that only cared for building cogs and their love. We left them be and suggested they remain inside.

We jump inside the now only working elevator and head all the way down the fortress. Otis once again hums that tune of his. Once reaching the bottom we jam the elevator again with the crowbar. At the bottom we fight some guard dwarfs and have a special “formation” technique to prevent us from getting into the throne room. We quickly make work of these fools before heading on.

Inside the throne room there’s not what I would have expected. A mushroom tree giant getting harassed by these four legged creatures which ripped off mushroom tree’s arm. They also seem to be gathering mushroom tree’s spores and getting high off them. We rush in and protect the helpless mushroom tree giant.

Our fighting the four legged creatures drew some attention of grow dwarfs in the area which barged into the middle of this fight in aid of the creatures and not the mushroom tree! Surly they’re not found of the mushroom ale as well.

The fighting is a bit longer than most we had so far and we come out victorious, but the question is if we should take a short rest or keep on pushing no matter what lies ahead.
