# 69 - Nice!

ðŸ“… 26th of Uktar, 0:48; Necropolis

We decide to leave the Tower of Abjuration

As we exit the tower there seems to be an earthquake and a 10ft wide hole appears in front of us and a huge creature starts climbing out.

- Vellynne sends some sort of attack at it and it seems to do nothing.
- Otis takes a swipe and that does seem to do something.
- ThodÃ¼rr gets in and does the same
- Ishamael hits it with a chill touch
- I hex it and get a good eldritch blast off at it
- The monster swings it's sledgehammer at otis and thodurr
- It moves giving otis a chance to try attacking it but he misses
- Red lands a strong hit on it
- Vellynne copies ishamael hitting it with a chill touch
- Otis lands some good hits with his hammer & from his cherub strongmen and follows it up by slapping thodurr on the but
- Thodurr lands a solid hit really making it look raged, he follows it up with another hit finishing it off
- The monster turns to stone.

We investigate the things sludge hammer but decide to leave it for now.

**we discuss possible item dupe bug in red's growing**

The group ponders if we'll also turn to stone if we die here, Xerophon thinks not.

We decide to head to the sports ball arena, on the way we discuss that after the arena we should rest.

Otis provides some healing to those that are hurt

We make it to the arena and see a shiny thing on a black pedestal. Ishamel tries to pick it up using mage hand. It seems to be a trophy, but as he tries to move it there's some sparks and he's unable to pick it up.

He then tries something else * stumping the DM * eventually sends the shield guardian to the pedestal, a voice starts talking and professor head translates saying we have 30 seconds to decide on our teammates. Red decides to go, Otis pushes xylophone into it, joining himself along with Ishamel and the shield guardian.

They play a confusing game of sports ball

The trophy goes to Ishamel so we apparently won. (trophy worth 1800gp) functions as stone of good luck

We debate whether we need a rest deciding no.

We head northward eventually finding another tower. Lynn sees a symbol on it for conguration and we decide to go in.

Thodurr eats from the table then spends some time touching himself and then speaks with the cat/owl/rat/snake thing.

It says the food is safe as is the chest, we can open the chest safely. I open up the chest. It feels magical to the touch but is empty when I open it. I use detect magic and it's definitely a conjuration we decide to rest for an our while I investigate the chest and otis attunes to his stone.

I discover I can say cheap items and the worth less than 1gp, it has 20 charges, 19 remaining for the day.

I start investigating the door, I try mage hand and have no success. I touch the door and appear in another room with a big insect man trapped in a circle. He asks me to release him which I hesitate to do as I have no idea why he was trapped to begin with. I inspect a desk and don't find anything, Otis appears and soon after Ishamel. I go to investigate the bookshelves and realize I don't read Netherese. Otis goes through the other door and disappears for a bit. When he gets back there was apparently a butler whom he didn't ask about the bug man.

Reading bookcase I find this info

- I start reading about how the residents kept weird pets
- Orchestra was well known throughout torreal
- They were looking for ancient relics of ostoria empire (spellcasting giants)

Otis goes back through the first door and ishamael messages him and him and waits for the animal downstairs to change, he then presses on the animal glowing on the wall to match and hears a thud in the desk to the north. I open the drawer of the desk. We find

- [Serpentine Owl](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5413-figurine-of-wondrous-power)
- 1000gp ruby (ishamael)
- 100gp charcoal, insense & herbs (I took)

- 300gp rare chalk and inks (ishamael)
- Scroll with "Second, Summon a flame in the palm of your hand"
