## Ingredients
### Batter
- [ ] 454g mashed banana
- [ ] ⅔ Cup butter/½ Cup Yoghurt/½ Cup Neutral Oil
- [ ] 213g brown sugar
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 1 tsp vanilla extract
- [ ] 233g whole wheat flour
- [ ] 1 tsp baking soda
- [ ] ½ tsp baking powder
- [ ] ¾ tsp salt
- [ ] 1 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)
- [ ] 57g chopped nuts

### Topping

- [ ] 13g sugar
- [ ] ½ tsp ground cinnamon

## Preperation
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the center position.
2. Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan; if pan is glass or stoneware, reduce oven temperature to 325°F.
3. In a large bowl, stir together the mashed banana, oil, sugar, eggs, and vanilla.
4. Mix the flours, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and chopped walnuts into the banana mixture.
5. Scoop the batter into the prepared pan.
6. Mix together the sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle over the batter.
7. Bake the bread for about 60 to 75 minutes, until the bread feels set on the top, and a paring knife (or other thin knife) inserted into the center comes out clean, or with just a few moist crumbs (but no wet batter).
    - If you have a digital thermometer, the bread's temperature at the center should register about 205°F.
    - If the bread appears to be browning too quickly, tent it with aluminum foil for the final 15 to 20 minutes of baking.
    - Note: If baking in a glass or stoneware pan, increase the baking time by 10 to 15 minutes.
8. Remove the bread from the oven.
9. Cool it in the pan for 15 minutes
10. loosen the edges, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool completely.
11. Store leftover bread, tightly wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.
